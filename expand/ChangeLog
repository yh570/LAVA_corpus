2008-01-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Do not define-away __attribute__ when __STRICT_ANSI__ is set.
	* src/system.h (__attribute__): Remove the __STRICT_ANSI__ disjunct.
	It has been unnecessary since approximately gcc-2.6, and now, leaving
	it would cause gcc -Werror -ansi to fail to compile csplit.c.
	* gl/lib/randread.c (__attribute__): Likewise.

2008-01-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Mention the configure.ac fix.

	in case they exist beforehand and are not writable.
	* build-aux/check.mk (am__check_pre): Likewise, remove $@-t.

2008-01-13  Elias Pipping  <pipping@gentoo.org>

	* configure.ac: Correct a non-portable use of sed.

2008-01-12  Mike Frysinger  <vapier@gentoo.org>

	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/12218/focus=12227

2008-01-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* README-hacking: Add Git to the list of required tools.

2008-01-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix a minor race condition when using cp -p --parents.
	* src/cp.c (make_dir_parents_private): If stat fails on the parent
	directory, do not add it to the list of directories whose modes
	might need fixing later.  Also, do not bother invoking 'stat'
	unless the stat results might be needed later.

2008-01-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	parent-perm: avoid a bizarre test failure.
	* tests/cp/parent-perm: Accommodate the situation in which
	chmod ("dir", 02755) returns 0 yet fails to set the S_ISGID bit.

	Remove uses of now-undefined Makefile variable.
	* src/Makefile.am (dir_LDADD, ls_LDADD, vdir_LDADD): Remove uses
	of no-longer-defined variable, $(LIB_ACL_TRIVIAL).

2008-01-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	cp (but not copy.c): plug a small leak.
	* src/cp.c (do_copy) [--parents]: Free the attribute list.

	Make a racy test failure less likely to happen.
	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Uncomment a debug "warn".
	This change happens to make this test far less likely to fail.
	With that statement commented out, this test would fail about
	20% of the time on my desktop.  Now, it's gone 100 iterations
	in a row with no failure.

	* NEWS: Mention the cp bug fix.

2008-01-07  Jan Blunck  <jblunck@suse.de>

	cp --parents: don't use uninitialized memory when restoring permissions
	* src/cp.c (make_dir_parents_private): Always stat each source
	directory, in case its permissions are required in re_protect,
	when setting permissions of a just-created destination directory.

2008-01-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	cp: add a test for today's bug fix.
	* tests/cp/parent-perm: New script.  Test today's change.
	Based on reproducer from Jan Blunck.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add parent-perm.

2008-01-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am (all_t): Add td, a new root-only test.
	(td): New target.
	* NEWS: Mention the improvement.

2008-01-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	touch: ignore "-d now" option, when appropriate
	* src/touch.c (main): Treat "-d now" as if it were absent, if
	neither -a nor -m is specified.  Problem reported by Dan Jacobson in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2008-01/msg00010.html

2008-01-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* tests/tr/Test.pm [tolower-F]: New test for the above fix.
	[upcase-xtra, dncase-xtra]: New tests, for a related code path.
	* NEWS: Mention the tr bug fix.

2008-01-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* doc/Makefile.am (sc-exponent-grouping):
	(syntax_checks): New variable.
	(sc-avoid-io, sc-avoid-non-zero, sc-avoid-timezone):
	(sc-avoid-zeroes, sc-use-small-caps-NUL): New rules, extracted
	from check-texinfo.
	(check-texinfo): Depend on $(syntax_checks).

2007-12-30  Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

	* src/dircolors.hin (TERM): Add gnome-256color.

2007-12-21  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/coreutils.texi: Fix a typo.  Avoid the term `relationals'.

2007-12-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Use comma-separated list in ./configure --help output.
	* configure.ac: Map commas to spaces in excluded-program list.
	Use a comma-separated list, not a space-separated one.
	* m4/include-exclude-prog.m4 (gl_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_PROG):
	Expect list of program names to be comma-separated.
	Reported by Jan Bauke Douma.

	Avoid another "make check" failure due to omitted programs.
	* tests/test-lib.sh (require_built_): New function.
	* tests/misc/groups-version: Use it to skip this test if
	either groups or id is not built.

	Avoid spurious "make check" failures due to omitted programs.
	* man/Makefile.am (distcheck-hook): Make check rules dependents of
	this target, not of check-local, so that people aren't distracted by
	failures due to programs omitted via --enable-no-install-program=...

2007-12-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/uniq.c (usage): Improve wording in --help "Note".

2007-12-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* src/uniq.c (usage): Note that sorting uniq's input is often useful.
	Suggested by Eric Blake.
	(usage): Say "key-selection", not "field-selection".
	Quote example commands consistently.

2007-12-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Version 6.9.91.

	* Makefile.cfg (gpg_key_ID): Use new, longer signing subkey.

2007-12-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

2007-12-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Add a test to exercise today's bug fix.
	* tests/misc/selinux: Test for today's bug fix.
	* NEWS: Mention the SELinux "ls -l" fix.

2007-12-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	"ls -l" wouldn't output "+" on SELinux hosts unless -Z was also given.
	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Also get the file context if -l is specified.
	Treat getfilecon failures like file_has_acl failures.
	(UNKNOWN_SECURITY_CONTEXT): New constant.
	(clear_files): Don't free it.
	(gobble_file): Set unknown security contexts to it; that way, we
	don't have to have special cases for unknown contexts.
	(print_long_format, print_file_name_and_frills): Don't worry
	about scontext being null, since it's always some string now.

2007-12-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Add the "Bug fixes" heading.

2007-12-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	"rm" as root would fail to unlink a non-directory on OS X 10.4.x
	* src/remove.c (remove_entry) ["can unlink directories"]: Fix a
	mistakenly reversed condition.
	* NEWS: Mention this bug fix.
	Reported by Pieter Bowman.

2007-12-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust shred.c offsets.

2007-12-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@rho.meyering.net>

	Reflect change in gnulib: don't include getpagesize.h,
	now that it's provided by unistd.h.
	* src/cat.c: Don't include getpagesize.h.
	* src/copy.c: Likewise.
	* src/dd.c: Likewise.
	* src/shred.c: Likewise.
	* src/split.c: Likewise.

2007-12-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Copy a .po file into place also when the target doesn't exist.
	* bootstrap (gnulib_tool): ... not just when the checksum differs.
	So now, if I manually remove po/xx.po, rerunning bootstrap will
	copy the latest into place.

	Make my-distcheck depend on "check".
	* Makefile.maint (my-distcheck): Also depend on "check", so I can't tag
	and release something that fails "make check" (however harmless) when
	run in a checked-out-from-git dir, but not in the distributed tarball.

	* NEWS: Add the usual "Noteworthy changes in release 6.9.91..." line.

	Remove just-installed su, if unable to make it set-UID root.
	Normally, su isn't even installed.  However, if you configure with
	--enable-install-program=su, and then install with insufficient
	privileges, we now make sure to remove the just-installed binary.
	* src/Makefile.am (install-exec-hook): Rename from install-exec-local,
	so that this rule is guaranteed to be run *after* installation.
	If unable to chown and chmod the installed "su" program, remove it.
	Reported by Greg Schaefer.

2007-12-01  Bob Proulx  <bob@proulx.com>

	Make existing-perm-race executable.
	* tests/cp/existing-perm-race: Update file mode.

2007-12-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Version 6.9.90.

	* NEWS: Remove the now-untrue statement about cp vs. dangling symlinks

	Change release procedure: tag *before* running e.g., "make stable".
	* Makefile.maint (vc-dist): Don't tag.  Now, you must apply the tag
	before running "make beta", "make stable", etc.
	(vc-tag-check): Remove rule.  No longer makes sense.

	* Makefile.maint (vc-tag-check): Correct check for existing git tag.

	Defer NEWS and ChangeLog checks until after the version-changing tag.
	* Makefile.maint (alpha beta major): Don't depend on the
	news-date-check changelog-check targets.  They must fail before
	applying the version-changing tag.  Instead, run them after "vc-dist".

	* NEWS: Record release date and new version number.
	Mention some of the SELinux changes.
	* src/stat.c (main): Adjust a comment.

	* TODO: Add some entries (documentation needed),
	and remove the one for mktemp.

	Add "extern" keyword to declaration of cp_options_default.
	* src/copy.c (cp_options_default): Mark as "extern", so the
	"sc_tight_scope" part of "make distcheck" passes.

2007-12-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Change comments: say bug present up to coreutils-6.9, not fixed in 6.10.
	* tests/cut/Test.pm: Adjust comment.
	* tests/misc/cut: Likewise.
	* tests/misc/ls-misc: Likewise.
	* tests/misc/od: Likewise.
	* tests/misc/stty-invalid: Likewise.
	* tests/tr/Test.pm: Likewise.

2007-11-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Add a test for cp -p and existing file permissions.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add existing-perm-race.
	* tests/cp/existing-perm-race: New test.  It isn't much of a
	test yet, since it's hard to catch the race, but it has a FIXME
	that will let us do a better test later.

2007-11-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix a security race with "cp -p A B" when B already exists.
	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options): New member owner_privileges.
	* src/copy.c (USE_ACL): Define to 0 if not defined, for convenience.
	(owner_failure_ok): New function.
	(set_owner): Avoid a security-related race by doing an extra chmod
	first if it looks like there might be trouble right after a chown.
	Accept a source struct stat rather than a uid and gid, and
	accept a boolean NEW_DST and destination struct stat.
	All callers changed.
	* src/copy.h (cp_options_default): New function, replacing the
	old chown_privileges.
	* src/copy.c (cp_options_default): Likewise.
	* src/cp.c (cp_option_init): Use it.
	* src/install.c (cp_option_init): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (cp_option_init): Likewise.

2007-11-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Avoid a spurious test failure when build directory is set-GID.
	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Ensure that '.'s set-GID bit is off.

	Be extra careful to quote $abs_top_builddir-derived names.
	* tests/misc/ls-misc (shell_quote): New function.
	Use it to quote file names derived from $abs_top_builddir,
	in case it contains shell meta-characters.  This is not currently
	needed, since CuTmpdir detects the fishy name and skips the test.
	But it's important enough to add the extra protection.
	Reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

	Include test name in the "unsafe working directory name" diagnostic.
	* tests/CuTmpdir.pm (import): If $ME is '-', use $prefix.

2007-11-30  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Add quotes to protect against white space in build dir name.
	* tests/check.mk (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Quote $(abs_srcdir).
	* tests/chmod/setgid: Quote absolute names.
	* tests/misc/help-version: Likewise.
	* tests/misc/pwd-unreadable-parent: Likewise.
	* tests/rmdir/ignore: Likewise.
	* tests/test-lib.sh: Likewise.

	Define `tst', for CU_TEST_NAME.
	* build-aux/check.mk (am__check_pre): Set `tst', for
	CU_TEST_NAME in tests/check.mk.

	* tests/CuTmpdir.pm (END): Do not do the cleanup if $dir is not
	defined, because it then goes wild and changes the mode of all
	directories below $HOME.  Undefined $dir can happen if the test
	is to be skipped because of an unsafe working directory name.

2007-11-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Close a file descriptor leak when cp --preserve=context fails.
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Close dest_desc too, if getfscreatecon
	or fsetfilecon fail.

2007-11-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* README: Document the known problem with gettext <= 0.17.

2007-11-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* gl/modules/randread (Depends-on): Remove nonexistent rand-isaac.

2007-11-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Don't block use of 'cat' or 'wc' in "make check".
	* Makefile.maint (my-distcheck): Add "cat" and "wc" to the list
	of programs that we can't blacklist.

	Fix md5sum+sha*sum on sparc: regenerate files with latest autoconf.
	* configure et al: Regenerate with very latest version of autoconf
	(v2.61a-312-gb524b0f), to fix md5sum and sha*sum miscompilation
	on big-endian systems (like sparc) due to lack of the required
	definition in of WORDS_BIGENDIAN in lib/config.h.

2007-11-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	setuidgid.c: more cleanup
	* src/setuidgid.c: Include "mgetgroups.h".
	(main): Don't presume there's a fixed limit on the maximum number
	of group IDs.  Don't use NGROUPS; it's artificially low.
	Change the name of a local: s/gids_count/n_gids/.
	Remove non-portable "const": s/const int tmp =.../int tmp =.../

2007-11-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Document install's -D option.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (install invocation): Document -D.
	Reported by Akim Demialle.

	setuidgid: Update --help output.
	* src/setuidgid.c (usage): Describe -g GID[,GID1...] option.
	Mention that USER may be a numeric ID or a user name.

2007-11-24  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Tweak new test.
	* tests/cp/preserve-gid: Split some long lines.
	Prepend "+" to numeric uid and gid chown arguments, on principle.
	Use skip_test_.

	setuidgid: minor clean-up.
	* setuidgid.c: Include "xstrtoul.h".
	(main): Detect overflow in string-to-gid_t and -to-uid_t conversions.
	Improve diagnostics.

	* src/setuidgid.c: Normalize leading white space: no more TABs.

	Test the new feature: cp -p preserves the GID whenever possible.
	* tests/cp/preserve-gid: New file.  Test for today's change.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add preserve-gid.
	* tests/Makefile.am (all_t): Add tc.
	(tc): New target.

	setuidgid: accept numeric UID, and new option -g GID,GID1,GID2,...
	* src/setuidgid.c: Add functionality for the new test above.

	"cp -p" tries to preserve GID even if preserving the UID fails.
	* NEWS: Mention this new feature.
	* src/copy.c (set_owner): Try to preserve just the GID,
	when initial fchown/lchown fails.
	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Likewise.

2007-11-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* src/runcon.c (main): Remove unused parameter, "envp".

	Add tests to show new class of strings accepted by date -d.
	* tests/misc/date (rel-1day, rel-plus1): New tests for the recent
	change in gnulib's getdate.y.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.

2007-11-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Quiet warnings about unused parameters.
	* src/copy.c (set_author) [!HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_AUTHOR]:
	"Use" each of the parameters.

	* GNUmakefile: Correct the "rerunning..." diagnostic.

	Make it easier to diagnose PATH-induced "make distcheck" failures.
	* Makefile.maint (write_loser): Define.
	(my-distcheck): Use an always-failing wrapper script, that gives
	a diagnostic, not "false".
	Run only "make -C tests check" with the restrictive PATH.
	Run the new gnulib-tests/ with the usual PATH.

	cp: by default, refuse to copy through a dangling destination symlink
	* NEWS: Mention this change.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (cp invocation): Describe the new behavior.
	* src/copy.c: No longer include "canonicalize.h".
	(copy_reg): Upon failure to open a dangling destination symlink,
	don't canonicalize the name, but rather fail (default) or, with
	POSIXLY_CORRECT, repeat the open call without O_EXCL (potentially
	dangerous).
	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options) [open_dangling_dest_symlink]:
	New member.  Reorder the others, grouping "bool" and "enum"
	members together.
	* tests/cp/thru-dangling: Test for changed and new behavior.
	* src/cp.c (cp_option_init): Initialize new member.
	* src/install.c (cp_option_init): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (cp_option_init): Likewise.

2007-11-21  PÃ¡draig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>

	* doc/coreutils.texi (split invocation): Improve the
	descriptions of the split command options.

2007-11-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust seq.c offsets.

2007-11-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Rewrite in an attempt to avoid the
	more-general rounding issues exposed by the previous patch.

2007-11-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust seq.c offsets.

	Remove unused parameter in remove.c.
	* src/remove.c (fd_to_subdirp): Remove unused parameter.
	(remove_cwd_entries, remove_dir): Update callers.

	bootstrap: work also with 4-argument variant of AC_INIT (from gnulib)
	2007-11-18  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>
	* bootstrap (gnulib_extra_files): Adjust sed command.

2007-11-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Correct preceding patch.
	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Also handle first < last && step < 0.
	* tests/misc/seq [empty-rev]: New test for this case.

	"seq .1 .1" would mistakenly generate no output on some systems
	* NEWS: Say this.
	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Handle another floating point corner case.
	This avoids failure of seq's eq-wid-7 test on FreeBSD 6.1.

2007-11-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port tests/rmdir/ignore away from GNU/Linux.
	* tests/rmdir/ignore: Don't assume that rmdir($PWD) will fail
	with errno==ENOTEMPTY when $PWD is not empty; Posix also allows
	rmdir to fail with errno==EBUSY.

2007-11-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Avoid an obscure new "make distcheck" failure.
	* Makefile.maint (my-distcheck): Also allow 'mv', for its use
	in gnulib-tests/Makefile.

2007-11-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port readlink-fp-loop to Solaris.
	* tests/misc/readlink-fp-loop (symlink_loop_msg): New var,
	which records the symlink-loop message, whose wording is
	not standardized by Posix.  Do not rely on "echo x > p/1"
	to work when p/1 has a lot of indirect symlinks.  (I'm surprised
	that it works on Linux.  Perhaps a Linux bug?)

2007-11-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port to Solaris 'make' and use a Posixish shell on Solaris.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add gnu-make, posix-shell.
	* build-aux/check.mk (SHELL): Set to $(PREFERABLY_POSIX_SHELL),
	so that commands can assume Posix syntax.
	(ENABLE_HARD_ERRORS, TEST_LOGS): Don't use GNU Make's "?=" syntax.
	(SH_E_WORKAROUND): New macro.
	(am__check_pre, $(TEST_SUITE_LOG)): Use it.
	(am__check_pre): Fail if "mkdir" fails.  Use $(SHELL)
	rather than relying on the "#!/bin/sh" in the file, so that tests
	can use Posix syntax.
	(am__check_pre, am__tty_colors): Use $$src rather than $$<, to
	support the Posix-make $(TEST_LOGS) rule.
	(%.log: %.test, %.log: %$(EXEEXT)): Remove unused inference rules
	that rely on a GNU Make extension and cause Solaris 'make' to fail.
	(SUFFIXES): New macro, so that we can use Posix style inference rules.
	(%.log: %): Use this rule only if GNU_MAKE.
	Set $$src so that macros can use $$src rather than $$<.
	(CHECK-FORCE, DEPENDENCY, $(TEST_LOGS)): New macros and rules,
	which rely only on Posix 'make' semantics, and are used only with
	non-GNU 'make' implementations.  $(TEST_LOGS) invokes 'make'
	recursively (and a bit inefficiently) to simulate the GNU 'make'
	rules.
	(.log.html): Renamed from "%.html: %.log", so that it relies only
	on Posix 'make' semantics.
	(check-clean, .PHONY): Do not depend on check-clean-local, since
	Solaris 'make' complains about nonexistent rules like that.
	* src/Makefile.am (SUFFIXES): Remove; no longer needed.
	(groups): Use a specific rule rather than an inference rule that
	is only instantiated once.  The inference-rule approach does not
	work with Solaris 'make', which gets confused by the "groups:
	Makefile" line.  It's not clear from the Posix spec that Solaris
	'make' is buggy here, so instead of worrying about it, rewrite
	the makefile so that it clearly conforms to Posix.
	* tests/check.mk (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Export PACKAGE_BUGREPORT.
	GNU 'make' does this automatically for us, but Solaris 'make'
	doesn't.

2007-11-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

2007-11-15  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* m4/include-exclude-prog.m4 (gl_REMOVE_PROG): Fix syntax error.
	Remove trailing space from result.

2007-11-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Avoid misbehavior of a cross-device "mv" or "install".
	Those programs must not dereference a destination symlink.
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Don't treat a dangling destination symlink
	differently in move mode.  In move mode, the only way the added
	O_EXCL can cause failure is when some other process has recreated
	the file this code unlinked a few instructions before.

2007-11-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Another bootstrap kludge.
	* bootstrap: Ensure gnulib-tests/test-*.sh are executable

	#ifdef-out matchpathcon-related code, for now.
	* src/install.c (setdefaultfilecon): #ifdef-out all of the
	matchpathcon-related code, until it's more efficient.
	(setdefaultfilecon): Instead of the above, stub-out the entire function.

	Use gnulib's stpncpy module, now required by install.c
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add stpncpy.

	Enable gnulib-tool's --with-tests option.
	* bootstrap: After all is done, transform the generated
	gnulib-tests/gnulib.mk.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_tool_option_extras): Set it here.
	* gnulib-tests/Makefile.am: New file.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add gnulib-tests.
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add gnulib-tests/Makefile.
	* m4/jm-macros.m4 (coreutils_MACROS) [ARGMATCH_DIE_DECL]: Omit the
	"extern " prefix to "void usage ()", so that the macro string value can
	be used to construct a function definition in gnulib's test-argmatch.c.

2007-11-12  Benno Schulenberg  <bensberg@justemail.net>

	Clarify description of cp's -a option.
	* src/cp.c (usage) [-a]: Remove unnecessary 'P'.
	Since option -d of 'cp' includes the function of -P, mentioning the
	latter in the description of option -a is redundant and therefore
	slightly confusing, as the reader tries to figure out what it adds.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (cp invocation): Likewise: s/-dpPR/-dpR/.

2007-11-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	bootstrap: fix typo to enable use of $gnulib_tool_option_extras.
	* bootstrap (gnulib_tool_options): Add a space before the use
	of $gnulib_tool_option_extras, so that it's separated from the
	preceding argument.

	install+SELinux: reduce a 12x performance hit to ~1.5x
	* src/install.c (setdefaultfilecon): Call matchpathcon_init_prefix,
	to mitigate what would otherwise be a large performance hit due to
	the use of matchpathcon.
	Dan Walsh suggested the use of matchpathcon_init_prefix.
	* gl/lib/se-selinux.in.h (matchpathcon_init_prefix): Define.

2007-11-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Adapt to gnulib's s/jm_/gl_/ cache variable renaming.
	* configure.ac: Change the cache variable name prefix "jm_" to "gl_",
	to match today's change in gnulib.

2007-11-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Fix bootstrap failure to handle files like lib/uniwidth/cjk.h.
	* bootstrap (cp_mark_as_generated): Create any required parent
	destination directories before copying a file into place.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust offsets.

	Don't use GNU-sed-specific \< \> operators here, either.
	* m4/include-exclude-prog.m4 (gl_REMOVE_PROG): Use a loop, as below.

	Use tighter regexps when performing name substitution.
	* man/Makefile.am (mapped_name): Add ^ and $$ anchors.

	Don't use GNU-sed-specific \< \> operators.
	* configure.ac (MAN): Transform ginstall.1 to install.1 using
	a loop, rather than sed with \<...\>.
	Problem reported by Bruno Haible.
	Andreas Schwab reminded me that \< and \> are not portable.

	Get git-version-gen from gnulib.
	* build-aux/git-version-gen: Remove file.
	* build-aux/.gitignore: Add git-version-gen.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add git-version-gen.

2007-11-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	git-version-gen: Sync from autoconf's version.
	* build-aux/git-version-gen: Run git-status

	Sync copyright and scriptversion bits from gnulib.
	* build-aux/git-version-gen: No semantic change.

	Change the first '-' to '.' in the snapshot version string,
	e.g., 6.9-377-08144 -> 6.9.377-08144
	* build-aux/git-version-gen: ... and add comments.

	seq: add another test for the %% bug.
	* tests/misc/seq (fmt-c): Test the other fixed case, too.

2007-11-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug with "seq 10.8 0.1 10.95", plus another bug with %% in format.

	* NEWS: Mention the %%-in-format bug fix.
	* src/seq.c (struct layout): New type.
	(long_double_format): New arg LAYOUT.  Fill it in.  Fix mishandling
	of %% in formats.
	(print_numbers): New arg LAYOUT.  Don't convert LAST to output format
	when deciding whether to go slightly past LAST.  Instead, convert
	X to output format and back.  This fixes a bug reported by
	Andreas Schwab in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2007-10/msg00237.html>
	where "seq 10.8 0.1 10.95" would output 11.0 on platforms where
	10.95 rounds to a value that prints as 11.0 when only one digit
	past the decimal point is asked for.
	(main): Compute layout, for benefit of print_numbers.
	* tests/misc/seq (float-3): Undo previous change, since the bug
	should be fixed now.
	(fmt-b): New test, for the %% bug.

2007-11-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* tests/misc/printf-surprise: Correct sed transform.
	Reported by Bob Proulx.

	Add example inspired by "make dist" running gzip and lzma in sequence.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (tee invocation): Show how to run tar just
	once, compressing the tee'd output streams in parallel.

	Say that the first process substitution example is contrived.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (tee invocation): ... and show how to do
	it properly.  Pointed out by James Antill.

	Use mktemp, not mkdtemp, to create test directories.
	* tests/test-lib.sh: Use the mktemp binary we've just built,
	not the mkdtemp script.
	* tests/mkdtemp: Remove file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove mkdtemp.

	Adjust a seq subtest not to depend on the vagaries of floating point.
	* tests/misc/seq (float-3): Use 10.94 as the endpoint, not 10.95,
	since 10.95 was precisely in the middle of the interval, and with
	a %.1f format could map to either 10.9 or 11.0.
	Reported by Mike Frysinger

	Make the new printf-surprise test more precise.
	* tests/test-lib.sh (require_ulimit_): New function.
	* tests/misc/printf-surprise: Use ulimit -v to trigger the fixed bug,
	and rather than checking printf's exit status (which would go wrong
	on FreeBSD 6.1, since their printf(3) function doesn't require
	lots of memory in this case) simply test whether it outputs
	the first 10 bytes.

	Accommodate FreeBSD 6.1 hard-link-to-symlink differences.
	* tests/cp/same-file: Detect when linking to a symlink links to
	the target of the symlink (FreeBSD 6.1 does this, Linux does not),
	and skip the few tests that would otherwise fail.
	Redirect output of final comparison to stderr, since all stdout
	is already redirected.

2007-10-31  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Fix a "make distcheck" failure.
	* Makefile.maint (my-distcheck): Don't stub-out dirname,
	since build-aux/check.mk now uses it.

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add xprintf-posix.

2007-10-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Avoid seq floating-point test failure on FreeBSD 6.1.
	* tests/misc/seq (float-4): Also accept -0.0.

2007-10-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Change a "make dist" diagnostic.
	* GNUmakefile: Don't imply that $(_curr-ver) is the new version string.

2007-10-29  Bob Proulx  <bob@proulx.com>

	Improve color terminal escape usage.
	* build-aux/check.mk (am__tty_colors): Use 'tput' to deduce
	terminal color capabilities.

2007-10-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Don't try to colorize a dumb terminal.
	* build-aux/check.mk (am__tty_colors): Skip colors if $TERM is "dumb".
	Thanks to Bob Proulx.

	Remove gnulib's printf-posix module, for now.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): It caused too many test failures.

	Remove spurious semicolon after "else".
	* build-aux/check.mk (am__tty_colors): Fix syntax error.

	If $TERM is empty, don't use colors.  This helps the buildbot,
	since it produces its result in an environment with a tty, but
	we don't want color codes in that case.
	* build-aux/check.mk (am__tty_colors): Test for nonempty $TERM.
	Suggestion from Bob Proulx.

	Always initialize terminal colorization string variables.
	* build-aux/check.mk (am__tty_colors): Always initialize red, grn, etc.,
	In case they're defined in the environment.

	Avoid test failure in non-srcdir build vs. the git tree.
	* tests/check.mk (vc_exe_in_TESTS): Run this test only in a
	srcdir build directory.  Reported by Andreas Schwab.

2007-10-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Define ENOTSUP, not ENOSYS.  Needed on OpenBSD 3.9.
	* gl/lib/se-context.in.h (ENOTSUP): Define if missing.
	* gl/lib/se-selinux.in.h: Likewise.

	Define ENODATA, for FreeBSD 5.0 and 6.1.
	* src/system.h (ENODATA): Define, if missing.

	Run autoreconf, not just autoconf, to avoid warnings.
	* GNUmakefile (dummy): Otherwise, we'd sometimes get a warning
	about autoconf version mismatch between what was used to generate
	aclocal.m4 and the currently-running autoconf.

	Require gnulib's printf-posix module, to support Interix.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add printf-posix.

	Help xgettext recognize more printf-style format strings.
	* bootstrap.conf (XGETTEXT_OPTIONS): Add directives for
	error, error_at_line, xasprintf, xfprintf and xprintf.

2007-10-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Adjust format string so msgfmt doesn't object.
	* src/df.c (main): Use "%s%s" (not %smsg) to print "msg" with or
	without a "Warning: " prefix.  Reported by Clytie Siddall.

	Clean up tests/Makefile.am.
	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove $(TESTS).  No longer defined.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Remove definition.

2007-10-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* build-aux/check.mk: Merge with latest from Akim.

	Add a test for the printf fix of 2007-10-21.
	* tests/misc/printf-surprise: New file.  Test for 2007-10-21's fix.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add printf-surprise.

2007-10-24  Micah Cowan  <micah@cowan.name>

	Remove vestiges of cvs-gnulib-checkout process.  Now we use git.
	* bootstrap: Remove support for now-unnecessary option, --cvs-user,
	and envvars CVS_USER, CVS_RSH.

2007-10-24  Micah Cowan  <micah@cowan.name>

	Tell xgettext that "ARG1 % ARG2" is not a C format string.
	* src/expr.c (usage): Add a comment to override xgettext's default
	behavior, which would classify "ARG1 % ARG2" as a fprintf-style
	format string.  Reported by Clytie Siddall.

2007-10-24  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Avoid diagnostics from sha1sum when there is no cached checksum.
	* bootstrap (update_po_files): Skip the sha1sum check if the po.s1
	file hasn't been created yet.

	Get gnulib from the git repository, not from an obsolete cvs one.
	* bootstrap: Suggestion from Micah Cowan.

	Doc improvements.
	* README-hacking: Prefer the no-hyphen variant of git commands,
	e.g., use "git pull" not "git-pull".
	Don't presume that the only way to read this document is via a
	prior git clone: provide instructions for cloning coreutils, too.

	* README-hacking: Add "cd automake" in build instructions.
	From Bob Proulx.

	Don't fail part 2 of tests/rm/unreadable when run as root.
	* tests/rm/unreadable: With UID == 0, expect different results.
	Reported by Mike Frysinger.

2007-10-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* README-hacking: Refer to LZMA Utils <http://tukaani.org/lzma/>.

2007-10-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* README-hacking: Describe how to build with LZMA.

2007-10-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Remove git-version-gen's first parameter.
	* build-aux/git-version-gen: Add comments.
	Remove first command-line parameter.
	* configure.ac: Remove corresponding first argument.
	* GNUmakefile (_curr-ver): Likewise.

2007-10-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Mention the printf fix.

	Reorder tests to run more basic ones earlier.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Reorder.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Reorder.

	tr: do not reject an unmatched [:lower:] or [:upper:] in SET1.
	* NEWS: Mention this.
	* src/tr.c (get_next) [RE_CHAR_CLASS]: Don't skip the loop when
	processing [:lower:] and [:upper:].
	(main): Require [:lower:] or [:upper:] in SET1 only when
	when one of those is specified in SET2.
	* tests/tr/Test.pm: Add tests for this fix.
	Reported by Per StarbÃ¤ck.

2007-10-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* tests/misc/help-version: Add a comment.

	Detect printf(3) failure due to ENOMEM.
	* src/printf.c: Include "xprintf.h"
	(print_direc): Use xprintf, rather than printf.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add xprintf.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add lib/xprintf.c.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

	Put always-failing programs first in PATH, so tests cannot mistakenly
	run installed versions.
	* Makefile.maint (my-distcheck): Set up a bogus bin/ dir, to be used
	for "make check".

	* doc/coreutils.texi (tee invocation): Fix typo.  Add a little.
	Add a cross-reference to bashref's Process Substitution node.

	Adjust tests to pass, now that Test.pm ones use check.mk.
	* tests/check.mk (vc_exe_in_TESTS): Adjust regexp not to match the
	"TESTS = $x-tests" line in each Test.pm-derived Makefile.am file.
	* tests/sort/main: Remove this unused file.

	Ensure that Test.pm-derived tests use the right $PATH.
	* tests/Makefile.am.in: Include $(top_srcdir)/tests/check.mk.

2007-10-20  Bob Proulx  <bob@proulx.com>

	Prevent "make check" from leaving mktemp /tmp/tmp.* files behind.
	* tests/misc/help-version (mktemp_args): Tell mktemp to create
	its temporary file in the current directory.

2007-10-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	to multiple _processes_, too.

2007-10-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* tests/misc/pwd-long: Use $abs_top_builddir/src, not $BUILD_SRC_DIR.

	* tests/rm/empty-name: Likewise.
	* tests/rm/unreadable: Likewise.

	Fix a minor typo.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Fix a typo (s/9.6/6.9/) that makes a
	difference only when running "make dist" without a .git/ subdir.

2007-10-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Move the help-version test into misc/.
	* tests/help-version: Move to...
	* tests/misc/help-version: ...here.
	Source test-lib.sh, as usual.
	Use $abs_top_builddir, rather than ".." and "../..".

	Make the runcon-no-reorder test slightly more general.
	* tests/misc/runcon-no-reorder: Don't hard-code "unconstrained_t".
	Use slightly more general "runcon $(id -Z)".
	Suggestion from Stephen Smalley.

	Skip the chcon test on a system with no SELinux support.
	* tests/test-lib.sh (require_selinux_): New function.
	* tests/misc/chcon: Use it.

	* src/dircolors.hin: Recognize .lzma as a compressed-file suffix.

	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Use dist-lzma, rather than dist-bzip2.

	Now that we don't install su, don't make misleading suggestions.
	* src/Makefile.am (install-exec-local) [$(INSTALL_SU) != yes]:
	Don't suggest running "make install-root".
	(uninstall-local) [$(INSTALL_SU) != yes]: Don't even check
	the installed binary.

2007-10-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	When forming a truncated name, use the "[...]" prefix even for
	an extremely long name in the current directory
	* src/remove.c (full_filename_): Rename a local variable.
	Use two separate "truncated" variables, in case the second
	call to right_justify does not indicate any truncation -- which
	would happen only if the single component FILENAME were longer
	than 511 bytes and DIR_NAME were empty.

	rm could malfunction under unusual circumstances:
	When operating on a relative name longer than 511 bytes,
	and (when either processing a directory that is neither writable
	nor readable (but still searchable) or when determining whether
	to prompt), and encountering an ENOMEM error while forming the
	file name, rm would operate on a truncated-to-511-byte name
	starting with "[...]" rather than the intended one.
	* NEWS: Describe the bugs.
	* src/remove.c: Correct two misuses of full_filename:
	(full_filename0, xfull_filename): New functions.
	(full_filename_): Rewrite to use full_filename0.
	(AD_pop_and_chdir): Use xfull_filename, not full_filename.
	(write_protected_non_symlink): Likewise.

2007-10-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Don't let a helper function modify errno.

	Reflect 2->3 GPL copyright version update in gnulib.
	* gl/lib/tempname.h: Update copyright from gnulib.
	* gl/lib/tempname.c: Likewise.

	[po/ChangeLog]
	* POTFILES.in: Add src/mktemp.c.

	Make tempname more random, via the randint module.
	* gl/modules/tempname (Depends-on): Add randint and stdbool.
	* gl/lib/tempname.c: Include randint.h and stdbool.h.
	(uint64_t): Remove definition.  Not needed.
	[_LIBC] (RANDOM_BITS): Remove this block, now that we have proper
	random bits.
	(check_x_suffix): New function.
	(gen_tempname_len): Rename from __gen_tempname.
	Add a parameter, x_suffix_len, telling how many X's there must be at
	the end of the template.
	Use pseudo-random numbers all the way, rather than adding 7777
	from one iteration to the next.
	(__gen_tempname): New function, to call gen_tempname_len, requiring a
	suffix length of 6.
	* gl/lib/tempname.h: Add prototype for gen_tempname_len.

	Convert coreutils' rand*.{c,h,m4} into modules.
	First step: move these files to gl/lib:
	* lib/rand-isaac.c, lib/rand-isaac.h
	* lib/randint.c, lib/randint.h
	* lib/randperm.c, lib/randperm.h
	* lib/randread.c, lib/randread.h
	Step 2: add modules/rand* and remove now-unneeded .m4 files.
	* gl/modules/randint: New file.
	* gl/modules/randperm: New file.
	* gl/modules/randread: New file.
	* m4/randint.m4: Remove file.

	* m4/prereq.m4 (gl_RANDINT, gl_RANDREAD, gl_RANDPERM): Don't require;
	These have been removed.

	Copy from gnulib the parts of tempname that we'll modify.
	* gl/lib/tempname.c: Copy from gnulib.
	* gl/lib/tempname.h: Likewise.
	* gl/modules/tempname: Likewise.
	Allow GPLv2 on temporarily(?)-imported file from gnulib/libc.
	* .x-sc_GPL_version: New file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_GPL_version

2007-10-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Avoid a pseudo-leak in sort.
	* src/sort.c (main) [lint]: Avoid a nominal leak.

	Use puts, rather than printf ("%s\n".  Slightly cleaner.
	* src/tsort.c (tsort): ...and more efficient.

	Avoid seq malfunction on non-POSIX systems: mingw, BeOS, Interix.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add vasprintf-posix.
	Suggestion from Bruno Haible.

	Avoid a used-uninitialized error.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't overload "use_stat".

2007-10-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Make a failing cross-partition mv give a sensible diagnostic.
	A cross-partition move of a file in a sticky tmpdir and owned by
	another user would evoke an invalid diagnostic after copying it:
	  mv: cannot remove `x': Operation not permitted
	Either of the following (mv.c, remove.c) changes would fix the bug by
	itself.  I think it's slightly better to use both; the added cost is
	minimal: mv: an extra lstat-per-mv-cmdline-arg-that-goes-cross-partition,
	rm: an extra lstat-per-unlink-that-fails-w/EPERM.
	* src/remove.c (remove_entry): Also lstat the file upon EPERM.
	* src/mv.c (rm_option_init): Initialize root_dev_ino just as is done
	in rm, so that a cross-partition invoked remove.c:rm call works the
	same way as one invoked from the command-line use of "rm".  That
	setting of root_dev_ino makes rm() do the equivalent of an additional
	lstat for each argument, which in turn gives rm enough information to
	issue the right diagnostic.
	* tests/mv/sticky-to-xpart (version): New file.  Test for the above.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add sticky-to-xpart.
	Arrange for "make check-root" to run the new root-only test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (tb): New target, to run the new root-only test.
	(all_t): Add tb.
	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust offsets.

	Add PACKAGE_VERSION to TESTS_ENVIRONMENT via check.mk.
	* tests/check.mk (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Add PACKAGE_VERSION here,
	rather than in every Makefile.am that needs it.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Remove PACKAGE_VERSION.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Likewise.

2007-10-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Adapt to new gnulib naming scheme.
	* gl/lib/se-context.in.h: Rename from gl/lib/se-context_.h.

	* gl/m4/selinux-context-h.m4: Remove use of AC_LIBSOURCES.
	* gl/m4/selinux-selinux-h.m4: Likewise.
	* gl/modules/selinux-h (Files, Makefile.am): Reflect renaming.

	(update_po_files): Work also when there are no .po files in po/.

	Remove test program: lib/t-fpending.c.
	* lib/t-fpending.c: Remove file.  Now, this test is in gnulib.
	* lib/Makefile.am: Remove associated rules.
	* .gitignore: Remove lib/t-fpending.

2007-10-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/selinux: Skip this test if the initial chcon fails.

2007-10-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Never copy through a symlink that cp has just created.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): When same-file detection requires
	'stat'ing the destination file, also 'lstat' it and ensure that
	it wasn't the destination of a preceding copy operation.
	This bug was introduced on 2007-06-18.
	* tests/cp/abuse: New test for the above.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add abuse.

2007-09-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	cp: do not abbreviate in --help output.

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Remove file-set, now that
	it's in gnulib, and the canonicalize module requires it there.
	* gl/lib/file-set.c, gl/lib/file-set.h, gl/modules/hash-triple: Remove.
	* gl/lib/hash-triple.c, gl/lib/hash-triple.h, gl/modules/file-set:
	Remove.

	* tests/misc/readlink-fp-loop: New file.  Test for the readlink bug
	fixed through today's change to Gnulib's canonicalize module.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add readlink-fp-loop.
	Bug report and a test case from mpb.mail@gmail.com.

2007-09-25  PÃ¡draig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>

	* doc/coreutils.texi (date invocation):
	Make "Date input formats" easier to navigate to.

2007-09-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Use XOR, not OR to combine bits.
	* gl/lib/hash-triple.c (triple_hash): Use XOR (^), not OR (|), to
	combine the bits from hashing the name and those of the inode number.
	Add a few comments and remove out-of-context ones.

2007-09-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: The recent rm-diagnostic fix also affects cross-partition "mv".

	copy.c: Remove definitions of factored-out functions.
	* src/copy.c: Include "file-set.h".
	(seen_file, record_file): Remove functions that I factored
	out on 2007-08-23.

2007-09-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't print the commands of a 10-line script that's run in each subdir.
	* tests/check.mk (vc_exe_in_TESTS): Add a leading "@", to reduce noise.

	rm: give a sensible diagnostic when failing to remove a symlink
	On some systems (those with openat et al), when rm would fail to
	remove a symlink, it would fail with the misleading diagnostic,
	"Too many levels of symbolic links".
	* NEWS: Mention the bug fix.
	* src/remove.c (is_nondir_lstat): New function.
	(remove_entry): Use it to catch failed-to-remove symlink (and any
	other non-dir) here so that we don't fall through and try to treat
	it as directory, which -- with a symlink -- would provoke the bogus
	ELOOP failure.
	* tests/rm/fail-eacces: Add a test for the above.
	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust offsets.

	rm: fix a tiny, nearly inconsequential bug.
	Don't perform a "."-relative lstat, when the file in question
	may well not be in ".".  Although this is a bug, a few attempts
	to exercise it on a linux-2.6.22 system failed.  You probably need
	a pre-openat system to trigger the failure.  The consequence of this
	bug would be a lower-quality diagnostic upon failed dir removal.
	* src/remove.c (is_dir_lstat): Add a parameter, fd_cwd.
	Use it instead of hard-coding AT_FDCWD.
	(remove_entry): Call is_dir_lstat with fd_cwd.

2007-09-22  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	Revamp most test scripts.

	* tests/rm/v-slash: Avoid test failure with non-C locale.

	* tests/selinux: Recognize that "unlabeled" means insufficient
	support for SELinux, just like "?".

2007-09-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Invoke $(AUTOCONF) manually, if needed to get an updated version string.
	* GNUmakefile: Don't actually touch configure.ac.
	That would make git-version-gen always print "...-dirty".

	Don't change '-'s to '.'s in the string from git-describe.
	* build-aux/git-version-gen: Leave '-'s in the string from git-describe.
	Otherwise, s/-/./g would make it too hard to distinguish the base

	bootstrap: uses rsync to download the .po files
	* bootstrap (po_download_command_format): New global.
	(download_po_files): Use rsync.
	(update_po_files): Don't remove .po files after download,
	so future rsync runs can take advantage of the copies.

2007-09-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* bootstrap (gnulib_tool): Make sha1sum check quietly.

	Ensure that snapshot version changes make it to groups, too.

2007-08-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Shorten the snapshot version string by removing the "g".
	* build-aux/git-version-gen: Remove git-describe's "g" that would
	always precede the abbreviated SHA1.  Suggestion from Dmitry V. Levin.

	Perform the s,rm,/bin/rm, fix-up properly.  No more kludge.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove .kludge-stamp.
	(.kludge-stamp): Remove rule.  Instead, ...
	(dist-hook): Do the job here, operating on the file in $(distdir).
	(rm_subst): Adjust regexp to match "rm -f rm$(EXEEXT)", not "rm -f rm".
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): s/+=/=/, now that this is the sole use.

	* src/od.c (skip): Call fseek even when n_skip is exactly the

	* bootstrap (slurp): Work even in environments where "ls" defaults

	* src/ptx.c: Remove --copyright option.

	Change interface: make 2nd param _space_-separated, not comma-separated
	* m4/include-exclude-prog.m4 (gl_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_PROG): Remove now-
	unnecessary use of tr.
	Improve comments.
	* configure.ac: Adjust caller, as well as the code that ensures the
	2nd parameter stays in sync with the list in src/Makefile.am.

2007-07-14  Karel Zak  <kzak@redhat.com>

	* m4/include-exclude-prog.m4 (gl_REMOVE_PROG): Fix typo: s/$2/$1/.
	(gl_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_PROG): Quote first use of $2 parameter.
	Don't mix comma- and space-separated lists.
	Patch from Karel Zak.

2007-07-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Warn about non-portable use of unescaped backslash at end of string,
	and treat it as if it were escaped.
	* src/tr.c (unquote): Considering that such usage would make GNU tr
	from coreutils-5.2.1 and earlier *fail*, the least we can do now is
	to warn about it.  Solaris' tr ignores it.
	* NEWS: Mention this.

	Use proper backslash-quoting inside backticks.
	* configure.ac: Otherwise we run afoul of strict GNU tr:
	a string ending in a lone backslash would provoke a failure.

2007-07-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Expand default-no-install prog list in ./configure --help output,
	and fix some []-quoting bugs in sed expressions.
	* configure.ac: Hard-code the list, "arch,su" here as well
	as in src/Makefile.am, and ensure the two stay in sync.
	* m4/include-exclude-prog.m4 (gl_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_PROG): Use $2,
	rather than the nearly-equivalent shell variable.
	Karel Zak reported that ./configure --help's output included
	the literal string, $gl_no_install_progs_default.

	Clean up include-exclude-prog.m4.
	* m4/include-exclude-prog.m4 (gl_ADD_PROG): Don't modify MAN.
	(gl_REMOVE_PROG): Likewise.
	Add omitted "\>" in sed regexp.
	Remove any leading or trailing spaces.
	(gl_ADD_PROG): Remove any leading space.
	* configure.ac: Instead, derive $MAN from $optional_bin_progs.
	Append $(EXEEXT) to *all* names, not just the first one.

2007-07-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	If there's a GPL vN copyright comment, require that N == 3.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_GPL_version): New rule.
	* tests/misc/arch: Fix the sole violation.

2007-07-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Skip "arch" test if it's not built.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (built_programs): Define.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Add $(built_programs), for...
	* tests/misc/arch: ...this: skip the test if arch is not built.
	* src/Makefile.am (built_programs.list): New rule.
	* tests/Makefile.am (built_programs): Rename from all_programs.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Use built_programs, not all_programs.
	* tests/help-version: Likewise.
	* NEWS: Mention that using --enable-no-install-program=X may
	cause "make check" to fail.

	Add support for enabling/disabling installation of specified programs.
	* NEWS: Mention new configure-time options.
	Mention that neither arch nor su is built/installed, by default.
	* m4/include-exclude-prog.m4: New file.
	* configure.ac: Use new macro, gl_ADD_PROG, rather than
	manually appending to OPTIONAL_BIN_PROGS and MAN.
	Move the code that adds "df" to the list of programs to build from
	m4/jm-macros into this file.
	Use gl_INCLUDE_EXCLUDE_PROG, then handle special cases: ginstall, [.
	(NO_INSTALL_PROGS_DEFAULT): AC_SUBST it.  Used by man/Makefile.am.
	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Remove from this list all man pages
	corresponding to "bin" programs. Add $(MAN) instead.
	(optional_mans): Remove all uses.
	(check-x-vs-1): Adapt to work even though arch and su are typically
	no longer built (and neither are their .1 files).
	* src/Makefile.am (install_su): Rename from INSTALL_SU, now that
	INSTALL_SU has a different meaning. Use the new $(INSTALL_SU) value.

2007-07-10  Karel Zak  <kzak@redhat.com>

	New program: arch
	* NEWS: Mention arch.
	* README: Add arch to the list of programs.
	* AUTHORS: Add arch.
	* src/uname.c: Include "uname.h".
	(PROGRAM_NAME): Handle arch, too.
	(ARCH_AUTHORS): Define.
	(uname_long_options, arch_long_options): Renamed and new globals.
	(usage): Handle arch-mode as well as uname-mode.
	(decode_switches): New function, extracted from main,
	to handle arch-mode as well as uname-mode.
	(main): Handle both modes.
	* src/uname-arch.c: New program, alias for "uname -m".
	* src/uname-uname.c: New file, default uname mode.
	* src/uname.h: New file, uname modes.
	* src/Makefile.am (EXTRA_PROGRAMS): Add arch.
	(uname_SOURCES, arch_SOURCES): Define.
	* man/arch.x: New file.
	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Add arch.1.
	(arch.1): New dependency.
	* tests/misc/arch: New test, compare "arch" with "uname -m"
	* configure.ac (OPTIONAL_BIN_PROGS): Add arch.
	(MAN): Add arch.1.
	* .x-sc_require_config_h: Exempt uname-arch.c and uname-uname.c
	from the always-include-<config.h> rule.

2007-07-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Change "version 2" to "version 3" in all copyright notices.

2007-07-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Compensate for new c99'isms in seq.c.
	* Makefile.maint (patch-check): Use -p1, not -p2, so a patch
	generated via "make patch-check REGEN=1" actually works.
	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Handle new c99'isms in seq.c.

2007-07-09  PÃ¡draig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>

	Fix the automatic number width formatting in seq.
	* src/seq.c: Fix the -w logic. Ignore spaces and '+'
	characters of input numbers when determining width.
	Set format correctly for input numbers in scientific notation.
	* tests/seq/basic: Add various number width tests.
	Details: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/10903>

2007-07-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Run the coreutils-specific code only if tests/Makefile.am.in exists.
	* bootstrap (mam_template): Move definition out of loop.

	Create symlinks for gl/{lib,m4}/*, just as for gnulib/{lib,m4}/*.
	* bootstrap (symlink_to_dir): Rename function from symlink_to_gnulib.
	Add a directory parameter.  Update all callers.
	(cp_mark_as_generated): Also check for -- and link to -- files in gl/.

	* THANKS: Add PÃ¡draig Brady.

2007-07-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Adapt to deeper hierarchy in gnulib.
	* bootstrap (symlink_to_dir): If the destination directory doesn't
	exist, create it. This is required at least for "lib/uniwidth/cjk.h".

	Use <wchar.h>, not "wcwidth.h".
	* src/wc.c: Now that gnulib provides the POSIX-specified <wchar.h>,
	include it and <wctype.h>, rather than "wcwidth.h".
	* src/ls.c: Include <wchar.h>, rather than "wcwidth.h".

2007-07-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	setuidgid: set all groups, not just the primary one.
	I wanted to use the xgetgroups function from id.c, so factored
	it out and made it into a non-exiting function (hence the "m"
	prefix rather than "x").
	* src/setuidgid.c (main): Use mgetgroups.
	Include "mgetgroups.h".

	* src/id.c (xgetgroups): Remove function.
	Include "mgetgroups.h".
	(print_group_list): Use mgetgroups, not xgetgroups.

	* gl/modules/mgetgroups: New module.
	* gl/lib/mgetgroups.c: New file.  mgetgroups is derived from
	id.c's xgetgroups function.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add mgetgroups.
	* gl/m4/mgetgroups.m4: New file.
	* gl/lib/mgetgroups.h: New file.

	* bootstrap: Merge in changes from gnulib.

	* src/id.c: Include "getugroups.h" rather than declaring manually.

2007-07-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: pr -F no longer suppresses the footer or the first two blank
	lines in the header.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (pr invocation): Likewise.  Also, a too-short
	page length implies -t, not -T.
	* src/pr.c (lines_per_header, lines_per_footer): Now constants.
	(init_parameters): Don't try to change them.
	(print_header): Use the same header and footer format regardless of
	wither form feeds are being used.
	(usage): Adjust to above change when describing too-short page length.
	Too-short page length impliesy -t, not -T.

	* NEWS: seq no longer mishandles obvious cases like
	"seq 0 0.000001 0.000003" by omitting the last output number.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (seq invocation): Remove advice about workaround
	for seq off-by-one problem, since the bug is fixed now.  Replace
	it with more-generic advice about rounding errors.
	* src/seq.c (long_double_format, print_numbers):
	New arg NUMERIC_FORMAT.  All uses changed.

2007-06-22  PÃ¡draig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>  (trivial change)

	removed someday.

2007-06-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	A few more symlink-related fixes.  Fix a bug triggered by cp
	--parents and symlinks.  Close some race conditions possible when
	the destination replaces a newly-created file with a symlink.
	* NEWS: Document that 'cp --parents' no longer mishandles
	symlinks in file name components of source.
	* src/copy.c (HAVE_LCHOWN): Default to false.
	(lchown) [!defined HAVE_LCHOWN]: Define to chown, for convenience.
	* src/cp.c (lchown) [!HAVE_LCHOWN]: Likewise.
	* src/install.c (lchown [!HAVE_LCHOWN]: Likewise.
	* src/copy.c (set_owner): Use lchown instead of chown, for safety

	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (change_attributes): Likewise.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Use ordinary C rather than an #if.
	* src/cp.c (lchown) [!HAVE_LCHOWN]: Define to chown, for convenience.
	(struct dir_attr): Cache the entire struct stat of the directory,
	rather than just its mode, so that we needn't stat the directory
	twice (which can lead to races).
	(re_protect): Don't use XSTAT as that's not appropriate in
	this context (symlinks should be followed here).  Instead, use
	the cached stat value.
	(make_dir_parents_private): Save dir's entire struct stat, not
	just its mode.
	* tests/cp/cp-parents: Add test to check against bug with
	cp --parents and symlinks.

2007-06-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Use mreadlink_with_size (doesn't exit), not xreadlink_with_size.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add readlink-with-size.

2007-06-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Make chgrp and chown diagnostics consistent.
	* src/chown.c (main): Emit the diagnostic before the file name,
	not after it, to be consistent with chgrp's diagnostic.
	* src/chgrp.c (parse_group): Emit a ":" between the diagnostic
	and the file name.
	Reported by Egmont Koblinger.
	* THANKS: Add Egmont Koblinger.

2007-06-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Correct cp's handling of destination symlinks in some cases.
	* NEWS: "cp" no longer considers a destination symlink to be the
	same as the referenced file when copying links or making backups.
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): When following a symlink, use the
	followed name in later chown etc. requests, so that the created
	file is affected, rather than the symlink.  Use O_NOFOLLOW on
	source when not dereferencing symlinks; this avoids a race.
	Preserve errno correctly when doing multiple open attempts on the
	destination.
	(copy_internal): Follow destination symlinks only when copying a
	regular file and only when we don't intend to remove or rename the
	destination first, regardless of whether following source
	symlinks; this is because since POSIX and tradition (e.g.,
	FreeBSD) say we should ordinarily follow destination symlinks if
	the system calls would ordinarily do so.
	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options): Add comment that 'dereference'
	is only for source files.
	* src/cp.c (usage): Note that --derereference etc. are only for
	source files.
	(make_dir_parents_private): Follow symlinks, regardless of whether
	--dereference is specified, because these are destination symlinks.
	* tests/cp/same-file: Adjust tests to match revised behavior.
	Filter out perror output since it might vary from host to host.
	Use sed alone instead of also using echo.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (cp invocation): Document the behavior better when
	the destination is a symlink.  Clarify source versus destination
	symlinks.  Describe the new behavior for destination symlinks.

2007-06-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c: Include "canonicalize.h".
	(copy_reg): Use canonicalize_filename_mode to follow the symlink,
	so that we can always open with O_EXCL and avoid a race.

	Don't include "quote.h" when it is not used.
	* src/md5sum.c: Remove unnecessary inclusion of "quote.h".

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust offsets.

2007-06-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Clarify what "cat" documentation means by "blank" lines.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (cat invocation): "Blank" lines actually mean
	empty lines.
	* src/cat.c (usage): Say that "nonblank" means nonempty.  Clarify
	--squeeze-blank.

2007-06-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	rmdir: give better diagnostics
	* src/rmdir.c (remove_parents): Give a more descriptive/consistent
	diagnostic upon failure.

	Suggestion from Joey Hess.
	* THANKS: Add Joey Hess.

	Don't include "quotearg.h" when it is not used.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_prohibit_quotearg_without_use): New rule.
	* src/cp.c: Don't include "quotearg.h".  It wasn't used.

	Reported by Steve Ward.

2007-06-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: Mention README-hacking, for whose who start from
	cloned/checked-out sources rather than from a distribution tarball.
	Reported by Steve Ward.
	* THANKS: Add Steve Ward.

2007-06-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	bug-fix: cp would fail to write through a dangling symlink
	* NEWS: Mention the bug fix.
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): When open fails with EEXIST, the destination
	is lstat'able, and a symlink, call open again, but now without O_EXCL.
	* tests/cp/thru-dangling: New file, to test for the above fix.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add thru-dangling.
	* THANKS: Add Michael McLagan.

2007-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/coreutils.texi (Common options): Mention that -h and
	--human-readable are equivalent to --block-size=human-readable.
	Documentation problem reported by Steve Ward in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2007-06/msg00007.html>.
	(du invocation): Use optSi rather than duplicating the macro's
	contents (incorrectly, since we claimed a "B" was output).

2007-05-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Pull printf-related code from gnulib, rather than using forked copy.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Don't avoid size_max and xsize
	modules.  While I dislike xsize-style overflow avoidance, maintaining
	a forked version of e.g., vasnprintf.c was too much work.

2007-05-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add screen-256color.
	Suggested by sdl.web@gmail.com in <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/239266>.

	* TODO: Add an entry for comm --output-delimiter=STR

2007-05-25  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	wc: ignore multibyte-character decoding errors
	* src/wc.c (wc): Don't issue an error message when mbrtowc
	indicates that we have seen an invalid byte sequence.  This
	makes "wc /bin/sh" bearable (though the word and line counts
	are likely not to be useful).
	* NEWS: Mention the change.

2007-05-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Check for an up-to-date copyright year in coreutils.texi.
	* Makefile.maint (copyright-check): Also check for an up-to-date
	copyright year in doc/$().texi, if that file exists.
	* doc/coreutils.texi: Add 2007 to list of Copyright years.
	Reported by Karl Berry.

	cut: diagnose a range starting with 0 (-f 0-2) as invalid, and
	give a better diagnostic for a field-number/offset of 0.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.
	* src/cut.c (ADD_RANGE_PAIR): Add an explicit check.
	Based on a patch from James Youngman.
	* tests/misc/cut: Add tests for the above.

	"cut -f 2-0" now fails; before, it was equivalent to "cut -f 2-"
	Also, diagnose the '-' in "cut -f -" as an invalid range, rather
	than interpreting it as the unlimited range, "1-".
	* NEWS: Mention these changes.
	* src/cut.c (set_fields): Don't interpret an accumulator "value"
	of 0 as an unspecified range endpoint.
	Give better diagnostics.
	Adjust a comment so that it is true also for 64-bit size_t.

	* tests/cut/Test.pm: Add tests for the above.

	stty: fix a harmless syntax nit
	* src/stty.c (visible): Use ";" as the statement terminator
	between two assignments, not ",".
	(integer_arg): Join an unnecessarily wrapped line.

2007-05-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	stty: diagnose an invalid hex value in 35-colon commmand-line argument
	* NEWS: Mention this.

	string robustly.
	* tests/stty/invalid: New file.  Test for the above.
	* tests/stty/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add invalid.
	* .x-sc_prohibit_atoi_atof: Don't exempt stty.c from this check.
	Add tests/stty/invalid so we don't have to obfuscate the comment
	about sscanf therein.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_prohibit_atoi_atof): Mention sscanf in the
	diagnostic, too.

	* TODO: Remove some now-completed or no longer relevant items.

	* src/touch.c (touch): Likewise.

2007-05-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (my-distcheck): Remove -pedantic from $(CFLAGS)
	for now, to avoid c89-check failure due to use of #include_next.

2007-05-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Generate a dozen test-related Makefile.am files at bootstrap-time.
	* README-hacking: Build-from-checkout now require Perl, too.

2007-05-12  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	Add -z option to uniq.  Originally proposed by Egmont Koblinger.
	* NEWS: Mention uniq's new option: --zero-terminated (-z).
	* src/uniq.c: Add new option, --zero-terminated (-z), to make
	uniq use the NUL byte as separator/delimiter rather than newline.
	(check_file): Add a parameter: delimiter.  Update caller.
	Use readlinebuffer_delim in place of readlinebuffer everywhere.
	(main): Handle the new option.
	(usage): Describe new option the same way sort does.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (uniq invocation): Describe the new option.

2007-05-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention that last week's tr bug dates back to 1992.

2007-05-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid test failure when run with an unusual umask.
	* tests/ls/color-dtype-dir: Set umask to 022.
	Suggestion from AIDA Shinra.

	Avoid failure of root-only test when run with a restrictive umask.
	* tests/rm/no-give-up: Ensure that non-root can access "d/" through
	root-owned ".".  Reported by AIDA Shinra.

	tr -c: don't abort when translating with S2 larger than complement of S1
	* src/tr.c (main): Remove invalid assertion triggered by e.g.,

	than Set1.  Reported by Guntram Blohm.
	* tests/tr/Test.pm (no-abort-1): Test for the above.
	* NEWS: Mention this bug fix.

	head -c, head -n, od -j, od -N, od -S, split -b, split -C,
	tail -c, tail -n.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (od invocation, head invocation, tail invocation):
	Document support for new size suffixes.
	(head invocation, tail invocation):
	Document that -n uses the same suffixes as -c.
	(tail invocation): More-clearly document what leading "+" does.
	* src/head.c (usage, string_to_integer): Support new suffixes.
	* src/od.c (usage, main): Likewise.

2007-04-24  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	ls --color once again colors dangling symlinks correctly
	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Much like the 2007-04-07 fix,
	add a term to the expression that decides whether we need
	stat and/or lstat calls.  Reported by Andreas Frische.

2007-04-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cut.c (usage): Adjust synopsis to show that an OPTION is required.
	Reported by Rudolf Kastl.
	* THANKS: Add Rudolf Kastl.

2007-04-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Form and compute length of strings for
	block size, owner, group, author, major+minor numbers and file size
	only if they'll actually be used.  I.e., don't form most of them
	when not producing long format output.

	Add a test for, and document, today's fix.
	* NEWS: Mention today's ls --color fix.

2007-04-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Initialize local "con", before calling
	getfscreatecon, in case that function (or its inline stub) does
	not set it.

2007-04-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Mention the bug fix.
	* tests/ls/x-option: New file.
	* tests/ls/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add x-option.

	gnulib moved md5 and sha1 modules into a new crypt/ directory; adapt

2007-03-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention these SELinux changes.

	* ChangeLog-selinux: Remove file.
	Move its contents into this file, removing old dates.

	* src/runcon.c (main): Don't reorder arguments.  Reported by
	Ulrich Drepper in <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/232652>.
	* tests/misc/runcon-no-reorder: New file.  Test for the above.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add runcon-no-reorder.

	* src/runcon.c (main): Remove "." at end of a diagnostic.

	* src/runcon.c: New program.
	* src/Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Add runcon.
	(runcon_LDADD): Define.
	* README: Add runcon to the list of programs.
	* AUTHORS: Add this: runcon: Russell Coker
	* tests/help-version: Add runcon as an exception.
	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Add runcon.1.
	(runcon.1): New dependency.

	mkfifo, mknod: Accept new "-Z, --context=C" option.
	* src/mkfifo.c, src/mknod.c: Include <selinux/selinux.h>.
	(main): Honor it.
	* src/Makefile.am (mkfifo_LDADD, mknod_LDADD): Use $(LIB_SELINUX).

	mkdir: Accept new "-Z, --context=C" option.
	* src/mkdir.c: Include <selinux/selinux.h>.
	(main): Honor it.
	* src/Makefile.am (mkdir_LDADD): Use $(LIB_SELINUX).

	* tests/selinux: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add selinux.
	* tests/misc/selinux: Source the new script, rather than open coding it.

	Change how "cp -a" and "cp --preserve=context" work with SELinux.
	Now, cp -a attempts to preserve context, but failure to do so does
	not change cp's exit status.  However "cp --preserve=context" is
	similar, but failure *does* cause cp to exit with nonzero status.
	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options) [require_preserve_context]: New member.
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg, copy_internal): Implement the above.
	* src/mv.c (cp_option_init): Initialize the new member.
	* src/install.c (cp_option_init): Likewise.
	* src/cp.c (cp_option_init): Likewise.
	(decode_preserve_arg): Set it or reset it.

	cp, mv, install: add SELinux support, but unlike with the Red Hat
	patch, mv and cp do not provide the "-Z context" option.
	* src/copy.c: Include <selinux/selinux.h>.
	(restore_default_fscreatecon): New function.
	(copy_reg): Make cp --preserve=context work for existing destination.
	(copy_internal): Likewise for new destinations.
	* src/copy.h (cp_options) [preserve_security_context]: New member.
	* src/cp.c: Include <selinux/selinux.h>.
	(selinux_enabled): New global.
	(usage): Mention new --preserve=context option.
	(PRESERVE_CONTEXT): Define/use.
	(decode_preserve_arg): Handle PRESERVE_CONTEXT.
	(main): Remove an obsolete comment.
	If --preserve=context is specified on a system without SELinux
	enabled, give a diagnostic and fail.
	* src/mv.c: Include <selinux/selinux.h>.
	Set x->preserve_security_context if SELinux is enabled.
	* src/install.c: Accept new "-Z, --context=C" option.
	Accept --preserve-context option (but not -P option).
	Accept alternate spelling: --preserve_context, for now.
	Include <selinux/selinux.h> and "quotearg.h".
	(selinux_enabled, use_default_selinux_context): New globals.
	(PRESERVE_CONTEXT_OPTION): Define.
	(cp_option_init): Default: do not preserve security context.
	(setdefaultfilecon): New function.
	(main): Honor new options.
	* src/Makefile.am (mv_LDADD, cp_LDADD, ginstall_LDADD):
	Add $(LIB_SELINUX).
	* src/system.h (GETOPT_SELINUX_CONTEXT_OPTION_DECL): Define.

	* tests/misc/selinux [VERBOSE]: Print version info for each
	of the tested tools, not just ls.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Remove the ls.c patch, now that I've
	temporarily removed the offending c99'ism.

	* src/chcon.c (usage): Split a string literal that was longer than 509.

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Don't call getfilecon unless print_scontext.
	Upon failed getfilecon, accept not just ENOTSUP, but also ENODATA.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust offsets.

	* AUTHORS: Add chcon.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Remove trailing blanks.

	* src/chcon.c: Don't include "dirname.h".  system.h already includes it.

	* gl/lib/selinux-at.c: Remove a use of HAVE_CONFIG_H.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Handle a new c99'ism in ls.c.

	* src/id.c (main): Tweak id -Z diagnostic.

	id: Add SELinux support: -Z option.
	* src/id.c (main): Apply patches from Fedora, with these changes:
	Remove #ifdef WITH_SELINUX.
	Use error (EXIT_FAILURE, not fprintf+exit(1).
	* src/Makefile.am (id_LDADD): Define, so as to add $(LIB_SELINUX).

	stat: Add support for SELinux in the form of a %C format directive.
	* src/stat.c (follow_links): Make this variable file-global.
	(out_file_context): New function.
	(print_statfs): Honor %C.
	(print_stat): Honor %C.
	(do_stat): Remove follow_links parameter.
	(usage): Document the two %C directives.
	(main): Accept -Z (though it's a no-op).
	* src/Makefile.am (stat_LDADD): Define.

	ls: Add support for SELinux and a slightly modified -Z option.
	I started with the patches from Red Hat.
	The entries below tell how the code evolved.

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format, print_file_name_and_frills): When
	there is no security context (due to getfilecon/lgetfilecon failing
	with e.g. ENOTSUP), print it as "?", not "".
	* src/ls.c (print_file_name_and_frills): Make -Z work without -l.
	(length_of_file_name_and_frills): Likewise.

	* src/ls.c: Remove the --lcontext and --scontext options.
	Change the way -Z, --context work so that it no longer implies -l.
	Thus, -Z -l will work like -lcontext and -Z without -l will work
	like --scontext.

	Adjust tests to reflect new 'ls -l' syntax -- affects only
	systems with SELinux when operating on a file with no ACL.
	These tests assumed that everything before the first space on
	each line is the 10-byte mode string.  But there may also be a "+"
	in the 11th column, just before the space.  However, note that this
	is not new.  The same thing would have happened even without the
	change below, when listing a file with an ACL.
	* tests/chmod/equals, tests/cp/cp-parents, tests/cp/fail-perm:
	* tests/cp/link-preserve, tests/install/basic-1, tests/misc/mknod:
	* tests/mkdir/parents, tests/mkdir/special-1, tests/mv/partition-perm:

	Don't make compilation depend on USE_ACL.  An SELinux security
	context counts as an "alternate access control method", so ls
	must output a "+" for each file with a security context.
	* src/ls.c [struct fileinfo] (have_acl): Declare unconditionally.
	(FILE_HAS_ACL): Remove macro definition.  Use f->have_acl directly.
	(gobble_file): Record whether a file has a security context, and
	update the condition used to determine whether to print the "+".
	(gobble_file): Call getfilecon/lgetfilecon also when
	format == long_format, so that we get the "+".

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Add a comment explaining why (with a
	security context option) ls doesn't exit nonzero due to e.g.,
	getfilecon failing with errno == ENOTSUP.

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Ignore failure of getfilecon if it's due
	to ENOTSUP.

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Factor out three small blocks using
	getfilecon and lgetfilecon.
	Don't ignore return value from getfilecon and lgetfilecon.

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Don't use ?: (empty 2nd arg with C
	ternary operator).
	(print_scontext_format): Likewise.
	(print_scontext): Declare to be "bool", not int.  Adjust uses.

	* src/Makefile.am (dir_LDADD, ls_LDADD, vdir_LDADD): Add $(LIB_SELINUX).

	* tests/misc/chcon: New file.
	* tests/misc/chcon-fail: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (check-root): Run new, root-only misc/chcon test.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add chcon and chcon-fail.

	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add selinux.
	* tests/misc/selinux: New file.
	* tests/help-version: Skip chcon.
	* man/chcon.x: New file.
	* man/Makefile.am: Build chcon.1.

	New program: chcon
	* gl/modules/selinux-at: New module.  Check for libselinux and set
	LIB_SELINUX here, unconditionally, rather than depending on
	the configure-time --enable-selinux option.
	* gl/modules/selinux-h: New module.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add selinux-at.
	* gl/lib/selinux-at.c, gl/lib/selinux-at.h: New files.
	* gl/lib/se-selinux_.h: New file.
	* gl/lib/se-context_.h: New file.
	* gl/m4/selinux-selinux-h.m4: New file.
	* gl/m4/selinux-context-h.m4: New file.
	* src/Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Add chcon.
	(chcon_LDADD): Define.
	* README: Add chcon to the list of programs.

	* src/who.c: Likewise.

2007-03-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: Use "install", not "ginstall" in the list of program names.
	* src/Makefile.am (check-README): Substitute s/ginstall/install/.

2007-03-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Regenerate.

2007-03-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Avoid the need for euidaccess and/or lstat on every directory entry
	with 'rm -r dir' (without -f), if we are root, or if we are removing
	a directory tree that is full of symbolic links.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add write-any-file.
	* src/copy.c: Include write-any-file.h.
	(UNWRITABLE): Remove macro, replacing with....
	(writable_destination): New function, which uses can_write_any_file
	to avoid the need for euidaccess when we are privileged.
	(overwrite_prompt, abandon_move): Use it.
	* src/remove.c: Include write-any-file.h.
	(D_TYPE): New macro.
	(DT_UNKNOWN, DT_DIR, DT_LNK) [!HAVE_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_TYPE]: New macros.
	(write_protected_non_symlink): Don't bother to stat if we can write
	any file.
	(prompt): New arg PDIRENT_TYPE.  All callers changed.
	Use readdir dirent type to avoid the need for 'lstat' on each directory
	entry in cases like 'rm -r dir', if we are root, or if the tree is
	full of symbolic links.
	(DT_IS_KNOWN, DT_MUST_BE): Remove.
	(remove_entry): New arg DIRENT_TYPE_ARG.  All callers changed.

2007-03-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	If strace malfunctions, skip the test rather than failing it.
	* tests/mv/atomic: Required on a mips-unknown-linux-gnu system
	running the aging linux-2.4.27-mipscvs-20040814.

2007-03-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/pathchk.c: Don't include euidaccess.h, as we don't call
	euidaccess.

2007-03-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README-package-renamed-to-coreutils: Add a URL for the FAQ,
	and a couple more archive links.

2007-03-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Post-release version change.
	* NEWS: Add a line for 6.9+.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Set new version string.

	Version 6.9.
	* NEWS: Record release date and new version number.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): New version number.

	* tests/mv/hard-3: Correct the preceding change: $3 -> $2.

2007-03-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve a test script.
	* tests/mv/hard-3: Check for 'ls' failure, too.
	Generate more-useful debugging output when 'ls' fails.

2007-03-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Fix a test script not to claim an ext2 file system is of type xfs.
	* tests/du/slink: When using df --local and df --type=TYPE,
	test only the exit code.  Don't bother with stdout.
	Prompted by a report by Thomas Schwinge of an inaccurate diagnostic.

	* gl/lib/savewd.c: Remove this file, since the savewd_save change
	is now in gnulib.  The other wasn't useful.

2007-03-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* gl/lib/acl.c: Remove this file, now that gnulib's version subsumes it.

	Skip part of this test when "." is not a local file system.
	* tests/install/basic-1: Otherwise, it would fail on some NFS
	file systems.
	* tests/mkdir/p-3: Likewise.

2007-03-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/Makefile.am (dir_LDADD, ls_LDADD, vdir_LDADD):
	Add $(LIB_ACL_TRIVIAL).

2007-03-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Fix a generic NFS-related test failure.
	* tests/mkdir/p-3: When setting up an unreadable "." in an
	inaccessible parent, make the parent inaccessible *after* making "."
	unreadable.  Otherwise, running "chmod a-r ." in an already-
	inaccessible parent would fail on NFS with "Stale NFS file handle".

	Fix a bug in how pr -m -s works.
	* NEWS: Describe how the fix affects pr.
	* src/pr.c (init_parameters): The --merge (-m) option does
	not imply --expand-tabs (-e), so don't set "untabify_input".
	Reported by Wis Macomson.
	* tests/misc/pr: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add pr.
	* THANKS: Update.

2007-03-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Detect use of AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR also when its argument is quoted.
	* bootstrap: Put ""s around use of $build_aux, in case
	someone uses a name containing shell meta-characters.
	Reported by Alfred M. Szmidt.
	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Add shuf to the list of tested commands.

	Avoid test failure on NFS-mounted Solaris ZFS file system.
	* tests/du/basic: Skip a test if "." is on a non-local file system.

	Avoid an obscure build failure, prefer waitpid over wait.
	* src/install.c (strip): Use waitpid, not wait.  It's equivalent,
	but feels less obsolescent.

	* bootstrap: Don't use \> in grep regexp.  For HP-UX.

2007-03-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Begin adding support for Solaris ZFS (4 entries per trivial ACL)
	* gl/lib/acl.c (ACL_NOT_WELL_SUPPORTED): New macro.
	(file_has_acl, copy_acl): Use it, rather than enumerating errno values.
	(is_trivial_acl): New function.  Incomplete, for now.
	(file_has_acl, copy_acl): Use the new function, rather than
	counting the number of entries in an ACL.

	* bootstrap: Update from gnulib.

	* .x-sc_prohibit_atoi_atof: Add TODO here, too.

2007-03-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c: Include filemode.h.
	(overwrite_prompt): Say "try to overwrite", not "overwrite", to
	make it clearer that the attempt may fail.  Problem reported by
	Dan Jacobson in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2007-03/msg00130.html
	Output symbolic mode as well as numeric.
	* tests/mv/i-2 (fail): Adjust to new prompt format.

2007-03-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Enforce policy: don't use *scanf functions.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_prohibit_atoi_atof): Add to regexp and diagnostic.
	* .x-sc_prohibit_atoi_atof: Give stty a temporary pass.
	* TODO: note that stty.c needs this small clean-up.

2007-03-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Prepare to work on ACL-related failure when using Solaris ZFS.
	* gl/lib/acl.c: New file, copied from gnulib.

	Work around a failing test due to an NFS-based race condition.
	* tests/cp/sparse: Accept a report that the copy is *smaller*.

2007-03-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Make bootstrap.conf a tiny bit more generic.
	* bootstrap.conf (XGETTEXT_OPTIONS): Exclude gettext-related .m4
	files when e.g., AM_GNU_GETTEXT([external] appears in configure.ac.

2007-03-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Try to fix today's NFS-related failure: Treat ESTALE like EACCES.
	* gl/lib/savewd.c: Copy this file from gnulib, then change
	"errno != EACCES" to (errno != EACCES && errno != ESTALE).
	The symptom was this failure in tests/install/basic-1:
	ginstall: cannot create directory `rel/a': Stale NFS file handle

	The preceding change solved part of the problem.  Now ginstall fails.
	* tests/install/basic-1: Temporarily, don't redirect ginstall's
	stderr to /dev/null, so I can see why the NFS autobuilder's NFS test
	is failing.

	* tests/install/basic-1: When setting up an unreadable "." in an
	inaccessible parent, make the parent inaccessible *after* making "."
	unreadable.  Otherwise, running "chmod a-r ." in an already-
	inaccessible parent would fail on NFS with "Stale NFS file handle".
	Reported by Bob Proulx.

	* Makefile.maint (po-check): Exclude c99-to-c89.diff.

2007-03-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid test failures on Darwin 7.9.0 (MacOS X 10.3.9)
	* tests/chgrp/basic: Don't let failure by chgrp to set the
	group of a symlink make this test fail.  Do give a diagnostic.
	In the chgrp-no-change-ctime test, add darwin7.9.0 as another
	known-failing system.
	When failing on some other system, print $host_triplet, too.
	Also avoid test failures on Darwin 8.8.x (MacOS X 10.4).
	Reported by Peter Fales.

2007-03-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Reflect the new c99'ism, update offsets.

2007-03-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	rm without -f: give a better diagnostic when euidaccess fails.
	* src/remove.c (write_protected_non_symlink): Return int, not bool,
	so that we can indicate failure too (as a postive error number).
	(prompt): If write_protected_non_symlink fails, report that error
	number and fail rather than charging ahead and removing the dubious
	entry.  Redo the logic of printing a diagnostic so that we need to
	invoke quote (full_filename (...)) only once.  More details at:
	<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/9952/focus=9996>

2007-03-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Generalize a few more cvs-isms.
	* bootstrap (checkout_only_file): Rename from CVS_only_file.
	Change comments and diagnostics not to say "CVS".

	* bootstrap: Run libtool, if necessary.

	Make bootstrap a little more general.
	* bootstrap (build_aux): Factor out/use this definition.
	Formally require a "AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR($build_aux)" line in configure.ac.
	(insert_sorted_if_absent): Move function definition "up", to
	precede new first use.
	If $build_aux/ doesn't exist initially, create it, and
	mark it as ignored.

2007-03-03  Andrew Church  <achurch@achurch.org>  (tiny change)
	    Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix a bug: cp -x would fail to set mount point permissions.
	* NEWS: mention cp -x bug fix
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't return immediately after
	copying a mount point that we do not intend to recurse under.
	Based on a patch by Andrew Church.

2007-03-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	pwd-unreadable-parent: Skip test on ia64/Linux, too.
	* tests/misc/pwd-unreadable-parent: Also skip when $REPLACE_GETCWD.
	Reported by Bob Proulx.

2007-03-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	pwd-unreadable-parent: Skip test on non-Linux/GNU systems.
	* tests/misc/pwd-unreadable-parent: Rather than trying to decide
	whether this test has a chance of succeeding, run it only when
	$(host_os) is linux-gnu.  It was failing on powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Add host_os=$(host_os).

	* tests/misc/pwd-long: Also allow "+" in $PWD.

	Remove another coreutils-ism.  Formatting cleanup.
	* Makefile.maint (my-distcheck): Update an outdated comment.
	(emit_upload_commands): Use $(PACKAGE) rather than "coreutils".
	(my-distcheck): Skip the c99/c89 check if there's no such .diff file.

2007-03-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (warn_cflags): Hoist, adding "-Dlint -O".
	(my-distcheck): Use the new variable, instead of too-long literal.

	Make "make syntax-check" rules less coreutils-specific.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_cast_of_x_alloc_return_value): Use CVS_LIST_EXCEPT.
	(sc_cast_of_alloca_return_value): Likewise.
	(sc_root_tests): Do nothing if there is no check-root target
	in tests/Makefile.am.

	Run the writable-files check only for release-building targets.
	* Makefile.maint (local-checks-available): Remove writable-files.
	(alpha beta major): Put it here, instead.

	"make syntax-check" now runs only Makefile.cfg-selected tests
	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check-rules): Hoist this definition so that
	it precedes the indirect use in the definition of $(local-check).
	(local-check): Use :=, not just "=".
	(syntax-check): Depend on $(local-check), not $(syntax-check-rules).

2007-02-28  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Replace xreadlink with
	xreadlink-with-size. Add xreadlink.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Update.
	* src/ls.c (is_directory): Update.
	* src/stat.c (print_stat): Update.
	* src/readlink.c (main): Use the one-argument xreadlink function.

2007-02-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* doc/coreutils.texi (Common options): --si outputs "M", not "MB".
	Problem reported by Philip Rowlands in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2007-02/msg00283.html>.

2007-02-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* .x-sc_file_system: Add the new test, tests/misc/df-P, to this
	list of exceptions, for the "make distcheck" sc_file_system rule.

	* Makefile.maint (gnulib_snapshot_date): Remove now-unused definition.

2007-02-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Make df -P immune to effects of e.g., the BLOCK_SIZE envvar.
	* NEWS: With -P, the default block size and output format is not
	affected by DF_BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE, or BLOCKSIZE.
	* src/df.c (main): Implement this.

2007-02-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Add a test for the above.
	* tests/misc/df-P: New file.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add df-P.

2007-02-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Adjust so that it works with
	announce-gen's --gnulib-snapshot-time-stamp option.
	Indent one of the command lines using TAB, not 8 spaces.

	Post-release version change.
	* NEWS: Add a line for 6.8+.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Set new version string.

2007-02-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Version 6.8.
	* NEWS: Record release date and new version number.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): New version number.

	Don't skip this test on new-enough Linux/GNU systems.
	* tests/misc/pwd-unreadable-parent: Test $REPLACE_GETCWD = 0,
	rather than for __GETCWD_PREFIX in config.h (the latter is no
	longer defined, ever, due to gnulib changes).
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Define REPLACE_GETCWD.

	Remove the "gnits" option; it prohibits my using "+" as a version
	string suffix, and all it does (beyond the default "gnu" option)
	is to _require_ the THANKS file.
	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Remove it.

	Remove all AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS settings in Makefile.am files.
	* tests/chgrp/Makefile.am, tests/chmod/Makefile.am:
	* tests/chown/Makefile.am, tests/cp/Makefile.am:
	* tests/du/Makefile.am, tests/expr/Makefile.am:
	* tests/factor/Makefile.am, tests/general/Makefile.am:

	* tests/rm/Makefile.am, tests/rmdir/Makefile.am:
	* tests/seq/Makefile.am, tests/stty/Makefile.am:
	* tests/tee/Makefile.am, tests/touch/Makefile.am:

	* README: Document the OSF/1 4.0d build failure and work-around.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* NEWS: Use a simple "+" suffix to denote pre-release, not "-dirty".
	Nicer connotations.
	* configure.ac: Use 6.7+, not 6.7-dirty.

2007-02-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: sort no longer compresses temporaries by default.
	* bootstrap.conf: Remove findprog.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (sort invocation): The default is to not
	compress.  Don't treat "" specially.
	* src/sort.c: Don't include findprog.h.
	(create_temp): Compress only if the user specified --compress-program.
	* tests/misc/sort-compress: Adjusts tests to match new behavior.

2007-02-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid a shell syntax error, when building with an inadequate Perl.
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Add quotes around $(PERL) in case, since
	it can expand to "/.../missing perl".

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Warn when unable to update a man page.
	Suggestion from Bruno Haible.

2007-02-23  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	Handle better the combination of old Perl and a pre-c99 compiler.
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): If the autoconf test has determined that
	perl is missing or not a sufficient version, do nothing.

	* tests/readlink/can-e: Put the closing double-quote at the end of a
	backquoted word, not in the middle. Works around a bug in sh on
	OSF/1 4.0d.
	* tests/readlink/can-f: Likewise.
	* tests/readlink/can-m: Likewise.

	* tests/du/slink: Skip the test if executing on an nfsv3 file system.
	This avoids a test failure at least on OSF/1 4.0d.

2007-02-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/date.c (usage): Split a diagnostic that had grown to be
	longer than the C89 maximum of 509 bytes.

2007-02-23  Ed Santiago <ed@edsantiago.com>

	* src/date.c (usage): Mention that --rfc-3339 uses space, not 'T',
	for a separator.  Include sample RFC 2822 and 3339 output.

2007-02-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	With -Dlint, make shuf free all heap-allocated storage.
	* src/shuf.c (main): Move declaration of input_lines to
	function scope, and initialize to NULL, so we can free it.
	[lint]: Free all malloc'd memory.
	* tests/misc/shuf: Also test shuf's -e and -i options.

2007-02-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Merge in a change from some other incarnation of this file (gzip?)
	* bootstrap (gnulib_tool): Skip get_translations if there is no po/ dir.

	Adjust preceding change not to perform an unaligned access.
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Undo previous change.  Instead, make
	it clearer that we're using a single-byte sentinel, and
	[lint]: Initialize sizeof (uintptr_t) - 1 bytes after the sentinel.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	Placate valgrind, wrt ./cp --sparse=always
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Place the sentinel by setting a
	full word's worth of bits, not just a single byte's worth.
	This avoids a harmless (but distracting) case of memory being
	used-uninitialized.

2007-02-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Honor dd's noatime flag if possible, even if not supported on build fs
	* doc/coreutils.texi (dd invocation): Warn that noatime might not be
	reliable.
	* src/dd.c (flags, usage): Look at O_NOATIME, not
	HAVE_WORKING_O_NOATIME, to decide whether to support the noatime
	flag, so that dd attempts O_NOATIME even if the build file system
	does not support it.  Problem reported by Jim Meyering today in
	bug-coreutils.
	* tests/dd/misc: Generate a warning, not a failure, if noatime
	exists but fails.

2007-02-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/date: Remove vestigial use of Data::Dumper.

2007-02-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c (cached_umask): Cast -1 to mode_t to avoid a warning
	about out-of-range initializer with Sun C 5.8.

2007-02-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* bootstrap (CVS_only_file): Use README-hacking.

	Now that we use GIT, not cvs, rename README-cvs.
	* README-hacking: Renamed from...
	Update to reflect that we now use git.

	* README-cvs: ...this.

	* src/env.c (main): When invoked with no arguments (i.e. when printing
	the environment), use a local variable to iterate through the global
	"environ" array, rather than "environ" itself.  This is solely to
	avoid changing the environment for an LD_PRELOAD-substituted "puts"
	or "exit" function.  Tiny patch by Harvey Eneman.  See
	<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/9735>.
	* THANKS: Update.

	* bootstrap: Move definitions of temporary directory names and the
	new bt_regex "up" to precede all uses, so it's clearer what their
	scope is.  Also, use [.], rather than \\., since the former works
	even if eval'd.

	* bootstrap: Remove occurrences of $bt (._bootmp) from lib/Makefile.
	Based on the bison 2007-02-19 change by Joel E. Denny.

2007-02-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: sort now uses a --compress-program option rather than
	an environment variable.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Document this.
	* src/sort.c (usage): Likewise.
	(COMPRESS_PROGRAM_OPTION): New const.
	(long_options, create_temp, main): Support new option.
	* tests/misc/sort-compress: Test it.

2007-02-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* bootstrap: Fix typo s/dowloading/downloading/ in --help output.

2007-02-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h: Don't include exit.h, now that it's subsumed
	by the gnulib-generated stdlib.h.

	* tests/rm/fail-eacces: Skip this test when running as root.
	Reported by Matthew Woehlke.

	* bootstrap: Use "._bootmp" as the temporary directory name,
	not ".#bootmp".  The latter's "#" caused trouble with the new,
	gnulib-added "LINK_WARNING_H = $(top_srcdir)/.#bootmp/..." line.

2007-02-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add c-strcase.  Remove strcase.
	* src/dircolors.c: Include c-strcase.h.
	(dc_parse_stream): Use c_strcasecmp rather than
	strcasecmp to avoid unreliable results in locales like Turkish
	where strcasecmp is incompatible with the C locale.

2007-02-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Also check for and print stderr output, in case a program fails.
	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Occasionally (not reproducible), this
	test would fail, with one or more programs exiting nonzero, e.g.,
	tty-eof: sha224sum exited with status 1 (expected 0)
	Now, maybe we'll get a clue, the next time that happens.

2007-02-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* .x-sc_useless_cpp_parens: Ignore a false-positive in a shell script.

	* tests/misc/pwd-unreadable-parent: Skip the test if we're
	definitely using the replacement.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Define CONFIG_HEADER.

2007-02-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Remove excess leading spaces that would make help2man misbehave.
	* src/printf.c (usage): Remove excess spaces on 2nd line of %b desc.
	* src/nl.c (usage): Remove excess spaces on 2nd line of pBRE desc.
	* src/dd.c (usage): Remove excess spaces on 2nd line of sync desc.
	* src/date.c (usage): Use two spaces after each optional flag, not one.
	Reported by Thomas Huriaux in <http://bugs.debian.org/410407>.

	* Makefile.maint (longopt_re): Relax the regexp, making square
	brackets optional, so it matches the newly reported violations, too.

	* src/csplit.c (usage): Use two spaces (not one) to separate
	each option string from its description, so help2man formats
	the derived man page properly.  Reported by Thomas Huriaux in
	<http://bugs.debian.org/410407>.
	* src/df.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/du.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/ls.c (usage): Likewise.

2007-02-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Test for today's gnulib/lib/getcwd.c fix affecting pwd and readlink
	* NEWS: Mention the bug fix.
	* tests/misc/pwd-unreadable-parent: New file.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Ad pwd-unreadable-parent.

2007-02-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Document fix for cp --preserve=mode.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Omit the group- or other-writeable
	permissions when creating a directory, to avoid a race condition
	if the special mode bits aren't right just after the directory is
	created.
	* src/cp.c (make_dir_parents_private): Likewise.
	* tests/cp/parent-perm-race: Test for the "cp --preserve=mode"
	race fix in copy.c.

	* NEWS: Document fix for cp --parents.
	* src/cp.c (make_dir_parents_private): Report the error sooner with
	"cp --parents DIR/FILE DEST" when DIR is a non-directory, thus not
	creating the directory, DEST/DIR.
	* tests/cp/cp-parents: Test for the non-race-condition bug fixed
	by the above change.

2007-02-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/nl.c (proc_text): Use "NULL", not "(struct re_registers *) 0".

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Make shred.c Index: and a/b prefixes
	consistent, so this can be applied with patch -p0.
	Reported by Matthew Woehlke.

	Arrange for "make check-root" to run the new root-only test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (t9): New target, to run tests/cp/cp-a-selinux.
	(all_t): Add t9.

	* Makefile.maint (patch-check): Use patch with its -p2 option,
	since that makes this check slightly more strict.

	Use a directory on a loopback device mounted with -o context=...
	* tests/cp/cp-a-selinux: Since this test now runs mount and umount,
	it is a root-only one.

2007-01-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Plug a leak in ls.
	* src/ls.c (print_dir): Don't leak a "DIR"+fd upon failure to
	determine dev/inode or upon detecting a symlink loop.

	* src/ls.c: Rename three global variables.
	(cwd_file): Rename from 'files'.
	(cwd_n_alloc): Rename from 'nfiles'.
	(cwd_n_used): Rename from 'files_index'.

	Shave 8 bytes off the size of "struct fileinfo".
	* src/ls.c (fileinfo): Put all members of type "bool" together.

2007-01-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Modify "ls" to sort its data faster, using the new gnulib mpsort
	module rather than qsort.  This is particularly a win in
	environments where strcoll is slow, since mpsort typically calls
	strcoll less often than qsort does.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add mpsort.
	* src/ls.c: Include mpsort.h.
	(sorted_file, sorted_file_alloc): New vars, for a new vector of
	pointers to the file info, for speed.
	(clear_files, extract_dirs_from_files, sort_files, print_current_files):
	(print_many_per_line, print_horizontal, print_with_commas):
	(calculate_columns): Set and use new vector.
	(initialize_ordering_vector): New function.

2007-01-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Adjust to today's change to gnulib, which added a module for
	string.h to replace the little include files like strcase.h.
	* src/dircolors.c: Don't include strcase.h.
	* src/system.h: Don't include mempcpy.h, memrchr.h, stpcpy.h, strpbrk.h.

2007-01-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dd.c (advance_input_after_read_error): Change diagnostic to
	say "invalid file offset" rather than "screwy file offset".

	* .x-sc_cast_of_argument_to_free: Remove this file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Likewise.

2007-01-25  Dan Hipschman  <dsh@linux.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (create_temp): Remove superfluous access-X_OK
	check.  find_in_path does this for us.

2007-01-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Remove usually-skipped test.
	* tests/cp/open-perm-race: Remove this file.  It is subsumed
	by parent-perm-race.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Remove open-perm-race.
	* tests/sort/Makefile.am: Regenerate.

	Pass "make distcheck" again.
	* src/sort.c (usage): Split a diagnostic that had grown to be
	longer than the C89 maximum of 509 bytes.
	* .x-sc_cast_of_argument_to_free: New file.  Allow a cast in sort.c.
	FIXME: this is just temporary, while we wait to remove the offending
	access-calling code.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_cast_of_argument_to_free.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_cast_of_argument_to_free): Use the
	canonical, $$($(CVS_LIST_EXCEPT)).
	* m4/.gitignore, m4/.cvsignore, lib/.gitignore, lib/.cvsignore: Update.

2007-01-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: New option sort -C, proposed by XCU ERN 127, which looks
	like it will be approved.  Also add --check=quiet, --check=silent
	as long aliases, and --check=diagnose-first as an alias for -c.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Document this.
	Also, mention that sort -c can take at most one file.
	* src/sort.c: Implement this.
	Include argmatch.h.
	(usage): Document the change.
	(CHECK_OPTION): New constant.
	(long_options): --check now takes an optional argument, and is now
	treated differently from 'c'.
	(check_args, check_types): New constant arrays.
	(check): New arg CHECKONLY, which suppresses diagnostic if -C.
	(main): Parse the new options.
	* tests/sort/Test.pm (02d, 02d, incompat5, incompat6):
	New tests for -C.

2007-01-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Fix a typo.
	* tests/misc/sort-compress: Use $abs_top_builddir, not $top_builddir.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Likewise.

	Don't depend on "which".
	* tests/misc/sort-compress (SORT): Use $abs_builddir, now which.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Export top_builddir.

2007-01-24  Dan Hipschman  <dsh@linux.ucla.edu>

	Test sort compression.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am: Add the test.
	* tests/misc/sort-compress: New file containing the tests.

2007-01-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: sort temp file compression: tweak wording.
	* src/sort.c (struct sortfile) [name]: Declare member to be const.

2007-01-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (MAX_FORK_RETRIES_COMPRESS, MAX_FORK_RETRIES_DECOMPRESS):
	In pipe_fork callers, use these named constants, not "2" and "8".
	(proctab, nprocs): Declare to be "static".
	(pipe_fork) [lint]: Initialize local, pid,
	to avoid unwarranted may-be-used-uninitialized warning.
	(create_temp): Use the active voice.  Describe parameters, too.

2007-01-21  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	Centralize all the uses of sigprocmask().  Don't restore an invalid
	saved mask.
	* src/sort.c (enter_cs, leave_cs): New functions for protecting
	code sequences against signal delivery.
	* (exit_cleanup): Use enter_cs and leave_cs instead of
	calling sigprocmask directly.
	(create_temp_file, pipe_fork, zaptemp): Likewise

2007-01-21  Dan Hipschman  <dsh@linux.ucla.edu>

	Add compression of temp files to sort.
	* NEWS: Mention this.
	* bootstrap.conf: Import findprog.
	* configure.ac: Add AC_FUNC_FORK.
	* doc/coreutils.texi: Document GNUSORT_COMPRESSOR environment
	variable.
	* src/sort.c (compress_program): New global, holds the name of the
	external compression program.

	(enum procstate, struct procnode): New types used by proctab.
	(proctab_hasher, proctab_comparator): New functions for proctab.
	(nprocs): New global, number of forked but unreaped children.
	(reap, reap_some): New function, wait for/cleanup forked processes.
	(register_proc, update_proc, wait_proc): New functions for adding,
	modifying and removing proctab entries.
	(create_temp_file): Change parameter type to pointer to file
	descriptor, and return type to pointer to struct tempnode.
	(dup2_or_die): New function used in create_temp and open_temp.
	(pipe_fork): New function, creates a pipe and child process.
	(create_temp): Creates a temp file and possibly a compression
	program to which we filter output.
	(open_temp): Opens a compressed temp file and creates a
	decompression process through which to filter the input.
	(mergefps): Change FILES parameter type to struct sortfile array
	and update access accordingly.  Use open_temp and reap_some.
	(avoid_trashing_input, merge): Change FILES parameter like
	mergefps and call create_temp instead of create_temp_file.
	(sort): Call create_temp instead of create_temp_file.
	Use reap_some.
	(avoid_trashing_input, merge, sort, main): Adapt to mergefps.

	The idea of compressing sorts temporary files was first
	suggested/implemented by Jay Soffian in 1998, and again
	by Charles Randall in 2001.

2007-01-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/pwd-long: Work properly even when run from the
	wrong one of two or more bind-mounted sibling directories.
	Suggestion from Mike Stone in <http://bugs.debian.org/380552>.

2007-01-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Standardize on list of signals when an app catches signals.
	* src/csplit.c (main): Also catch SIGALRM, SIGPIPE, SIGPOLL,
	SIGPROF, SIGVTALRM, SIGXCPU, SIGXFSZ.
	* src/ls.c (main): Likewise (except SIGPIPE was already caught).
	Note that ls.c is special, as it also catches SIGTSTP.
	* src/sort.c (main): Likewise.  Also catch SIGQUIT.  More details in
	<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/9510>.

2007-01-19  Dan Hipschman  <dsh@linux.ucla.edu>
	and Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (cleanup): Clear temphead at the end.
	(exit_cleanup): New function.
	(main): Don't invoke atexit until we're ready.
	Invoke it with exit_cleanup, not with cleanup and close_stdout,
	to avoid a race condition with cleanup and signal handling.  More
	details: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/9508

2007-01-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust remove.c offsets.

2007-01-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Make "rm --interactive=never ..." never prompt.
	* NEWS: Mention this.
	* src/remove.h (enum rm_interactive): New ternary type.
	(struct rm_options) [interactive]: Use it, here -- rather than bool.
	* src/remove.c (prompt): Reflect type change.
	* src/mv.c (rm_option_init): Initialize to RMI_NEVER now.
	* src/rm.c (main): Add a FIXME comment for '-d' option.
	Adapt to type change of rm_options.interactive.

	* tests/rm/i-never: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add i-never.

2007-01-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* bootstrap (gnulib_tool): When adding to .cvsignore and .gitignore,
	emit foo.h, for each foo_.h.  This yields one false-positive, fts.h,
	but that's ok, since fts_.h will eventually be renamed.

	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): Don't use errno in diagnostic.
	Root-only test failure reported by Alex van Hout and Jon Grosshart in
	<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/9415/focus=9415>.

	* bootstrap.conf (avoided_gnulib_modules): Fix my typo:
	s/--avoid=canonicalize-lgpl/--avoid=canonicalize-gpl/

2007-01-14  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	Enable use of gnulib's new fchdir module.
	* bootstrap.conf (avoided_gnulib_modules): Avoid canonicalize-lgpl,
	since we use canonicalize.
	(gnulib_modules): Add fchdir.
	* m4/jm-macros.m4 (coreutils_MACROS): Remove fchdir-stub.

2007-01-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/cp/open-perm-race: Remove gdb-based test.
	It would run only when compiled with -g, and besides is now
	subsumed by file-perm-race.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Remove open-perm-race.

	* Transform all Makefile.am files so that when running "make check",
	CU_TEST_NAME is set to the name of the test.  This is so that when I
	run valgrind-enabled (--log-file-qualifier=CU_TEST_NAME) "make check"
	on the entire package it is more convenient to map a leak or error
	found in a valgrind log file back to the offending test.
	Use this command:
	(echo tests/Makefile.am.in; find tests -name Makefile.am) \
	 |xargs perl -pi -e '/^(\s*)PATH=...VG_PATH_PREFIX/ and ' \
	   -e 'print $1,q|CU_TEST_NAME=`basename $(abs_srcdir)`,$$tst |,"\\\n"'

2007-01-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid a leak in expr's implementation of the ":" (match) operator.
	* src/expr.c (docolon): Free the regexp buffer using regfree, rather
	than doing it manually, being careful to set fastmap to NULL first.
	Free any re_regs.start and .end members, if necessary.

	* tests/misc/test-diag: Work also when libc's error function
	reports the entire program name ("../../src/test"), rather than
	just the final component.

2007-01-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't use fts_statp uninitialized for "chown -RLh --preserve-root ...".
	* src/chown-core.c (FTSENT_IS_DIRECTORY): New macro.
	(change_file_owner): Perform the ROOT_DEV_INO_CHECK only for a
	directory.  Non-directory entries lack fts_statp data when using
	the FTS_NOSTAT option.

2007-01-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/sample-test: Update copyright date to 2007.
	* Makefile.maint (copyright-check): Also check the copyright date
	in tests/sample-test.

2007-01-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/fmt/basic (pfx-only, pfx-of-pfx): New tests,
	based on examples from G.P. Halkes in
	<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/9388>.

2007-01-06  G.P. Halkes  <buscom@ghalkes.nl>

	* src/fmt.c (copy_rest): Correct prefix handling.
	Don't elide a line with the prefix followed by only white space.
	(get_line): Move EOF-check to loop-termination condition.
	* tests/fmt/basic (pfx-1): Adjust test to expect desired result.
	(pfx-2): Remove test; its premise was contrary to the documentation.

2007-01-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid a used-uninitialized bug for invalid input, i.e., when the size
	of the input, not counting newlines, is 1 % 4.
	* gl/lib/base64.c (base64_decode): Don't hard-code inlen==4.
	It may be smaller when flushing.

2007-01-05  Mike Frysinger  <vapier@gentoo.org>

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add a TERM directive for cons25.

2007-01-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.cfg (local-checks-to-skip): Skip strftime-check, in
	case you don't have convenient access to glibc info documentation.

	Use the release year, not the current year.
	* src/groups.sh (version): Use a better name: @RELEASE_YEAR@.
	* src/Makefile.am (RELEASE_YEAR): Define it.
	(.sh): Use it.
	Thanks to a prod from Eric Blake.

	Ensure that "group --version" always prints the current year.
	* src/groups.sh (version): Use @CURRENT_YEAR@, rather than 2006.
	* src/Makefile.am (.sh): Also substitute for @CURRENT_YEAR@.
	Suggestion from Eric Blake.

	When decoding, always allow newlines in input, with almost no
	performance impact.
	* src/base64.c (do_decode): Initialize decode context.
	Call base64_decode one more time, after all input is processed.
	(usage): When decoding, newlines are always accepted.

	* tests/misc/base64: Add a bunch of tests, for the above.
	* gl/lib/base64.c: Include <string.h>.
	(base64_decode_ctx_init, get_4, decode_4): New functions.
	(base64_decode): Efficiently handle interspersed newlines.
	(base64_decode_alloc): Update signature.
	* gl/lib/base64.h (struct base64_decode_context): Define.
	(base64_decode_ctx_init): Add prototype.
	(base64_decode, base64_decode_alloc): Update prototypes.

	* gl/lib/base64.c: Copied from gnulib.
	* gl/lib/base64.h: Likewise.

2007-01-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* THANKS: Add Evan Hunt.

2007-01-03  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	Avoid spurious test failures on MacOS X 10.3.9, in a German locale.
	* tests/chown/deref: Apply lang-default.
	* tests/misc/split-a: Likewise.
	* tests/mv/reply-no: Likewise.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Use mkfifo as a fallback if mknod fails.
	Needed on MacOS X.

2007-01-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Now, "ls -FRL" always follows symbolic links on Linux.
	* NEWS: Mention this bug fix.
	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Fix bug reported by
	Nobuyuki Tsuchimura in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-12/msg00152.html
	where "ls -FRL" didn't follow a symbolic link in some cases on Linux.
	* tests/ls/follow-slink: Add a test for this case.

2007-01-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Revert last change.  The PATH=... setting
	is not honored at least on HP-UX 11.23 systems.
	Instead, simply transform the actual output diagnostic.
	Test failure reported by Bob Proulx.

2006-12-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* bootstrap (gnulib_extra_files): Remove announce-gen.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add it here instead, now that
	it's a module.

	* tests/misc/base64: Factor a long, repetitive string.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust remove.c offsets.

	Clean up after the change of 2006-12-28.
	* src/remove.c (AD_pop_and_chdir): Change **DIRP parameter to *DIRP,
	now that this function never modifies the pointer.  Adjust comments
	and code accordingly.
	(remove_dir): Set "dirp" to NULL right after AD_pop_and_chdir call,
	now that AD_pop_and_chdir no longer does that.

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Avoid spurious differences (the error function
	from latest glibc no longer prints the full program_name): so don't
	invoke rm via ../../src/rm.  Instead, invoke it via "PATH=../../src rm".

	* tests/mv/acl (skip): Skip this test also if the destination
	directory, which is on a different file system, lacks ACL support.

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Rewrite a comment that was rendered
	inaccurate by the 2006-10-18 change.

2006-12-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	When moving "up" the hierarchy, be careful to remove a just-emptied
	directory before opening ".", to avoid trouble with file system
	implementations that cache readdir results at opendir-time.
	* src/remove.c (AD_pop_and_chdir): Add a file descriptor parameter.
	Don't update **DIRP.  Don't call fdopendir here.
	(remove_dir): Call fdopendir here instead.
	Report and patch from Mikulas Patocka:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-12/msg00170.html>

2006-12-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tail.c (usage): Mention +N for --bytes and --lines.
	Suggestion from Evan Hunt.

2006-12-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Require autoconf-2.61 and automake-1.10.
	Without the former (even with autoconf-2.60), "make distcheck"
	would fail (without the 2006-09-26 autoconf AC_CHECK_DECL fix),
	due to an inttypes.h generated with CFLAGS including -pedantic.
	With the old decl check, @HAVE_DECL_STRTOUMAX@ would be 0.

	* Makefile.maint (VC-tag): Define, so as to gpg-sign each release
	tag, using the release version number as the message.
	(vc-dist): Use $(VC-tag), rather than "$(VC) tag".

2006-12-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: dd bs= operands now silently override later ibs= and obs=,
	as POSIX requires.
	* src/dd.c (scanargs): Implement it.
	* tests/dd/misc (outbytes): Test it.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (dd invocation): Specify that bs=N
	overrides later ibs and obs, undoing part of the
	previous change.  (The behavior was wrong.)

2006-12-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	"rm -rf /etc/motd" (run by non-root) now prints a diagnostic.
	* src/remove.c (remove_entry): Handle EACCES for a non-directory, too.
	Don't let a non-directory get by with errno == EPERM, either.
	Check the file type directly (using cached stat value), rather
	than trying to guess it from errno values.
	Karl Berry reported that a cross-partition "mv /etc/issue ~"
	failed with the um,... suboptimal diagnostic,
	"mv: cannot remove `/etc/issue': Not a directory".
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fail-eacces.
	* tests/rm/fail-eacces: New file.
	* NEWS: Mention that both mv and rm are affected.

	"cut -f 2- A B" no longer triggers a double-free bug
	* src/cut.c (cut_fields): Set file-scoped global to NULL after
	freeing it.  This avoids a double-free (and core dump on some systems)
	for this usage: "echo 1>a; echo 2>b; cut -f2- a b".  Reported by
	James Hunt in <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/220312>.
	* NEWS: List this bug fix.
	* THANKS: Mention him.
	* tests/misc/cut: New file.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add cut.

2006-12-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/cp/open-perm-race: Correct the gdb-existence check.
	Don't run either subsequent gdb command in a sub-shell.
	Reported by Thomas Schwinge.
	* THANKS: bring up to date.

2006-12-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Make sure cp -p isn't too generous with file permissions.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add file-perm-race.
	* tests/cp/file-perm-race: New file.

	Ensure cp -pR --parents isn't too generous with parent permissions.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add parent-perm-race.
	* tests/cp/parent-perm-race: New file.

2006-12-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/chgrp/default-no-deref: Don't assume that files are created
	with the primary group by default.  That's not true in a directory
	with the set-GID bit set.

	Don't hang when there's no input tty.
	* tests/cp/open-perm-race: Skip this test if there is no
	controlling input `terminal'.

	Test for a hard-to-detect race fix, using gdb.
	* tests/cp/open-perm-race: New file, to test for the
	cp --preserve=ownership fix of 2006-12-06.

	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Define abs_top_builddir.
	(TESTS): Add open-perm-race.

	* src/chgrp.c (main): Don't prohibit -RLh, aka -RL with --no-dereference.
	* src/chown.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Add to a comment.
	* tests/chown/preserve-root: Add tests.

	* NEWS: --preserve-root now works with chgrp, chmod, and chown.
	* src/chmod.c (process_file): Do honor the --preserve-root option.
	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Likewise, but here, also
	handle the case in which a traversal would go "through" a symlink
	to root.  Reported by Matthew M. Boedicker
	* tests/chown/preserve-root: Test for the above.
	* tests/chown/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add preserve-root.

	* NEWS: Mention the chmod fix induced by the 2006-12-11 change
	to gnulib's m4/openat.m4.

2006-12-13  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	Don't fail if mv/acl test succeeds.
	* tests/mv/acl (skip): Check for acl support in the file system.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Pass CONFIG_HEADER.

2006-12-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Remove some arbitrary restrictions on size fields, so that
	commands like "sort -k 18446744073709551616" no longer fail merely
	because 18446744073709551616 doesn't fit in uintmax_t.  The trick
	is that these fields can all be treated as effectively infinity;
	their exact values don't matter, since no internal buffer can be
	that long.
	* src/join.c (string_to_join_field): Verify that SIZE_MAX <=
	ULONG_MAX if the code assumes this.  Silently truncate too-large
	values to SIZE_MAX, as the remaining code will do the right thing
	in this case.
	* src/sort.c (parse_field_count): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (size_opt, main): Likewise.
	* tests/join/Test.pm (bigfield): New test.

2006-12-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/chgrp/default-no-deref: New test.
	* tests/chgrp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add default-no-deref.

2006-12-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (SETVBUF): Remove definition, now that the
	autoconf macro, AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED, does nothing.
	* src/tee.c (tee_files): s/SETVBUF/setvbuf/.
	* src/od.c (open_next_file): Likewise.

2006-12-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Make help2man use $(PACKAGE_STRING) as the
	"source".  I.e. "GNU coreutils 6.7".

	* NEWS: With the change from "-pre" to "-dirty" suffix, also change
	from NEXT_VER-pre to CUR_VER-dirty.  So, this is 6.7-dirty.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): s/6.8-dirty/6.7-dirty/.

	* tests/uniq/Test.pm (test_vector): Skip the pipe-reading test
	whenever uniq is expected to fail.  This should catch the other case
	[test #112] in which uniq emits "cat: write error: Broken pipe" on
	some systems.

2006-12-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Include bootstrap tool version info in the announcement form.
	* Makefile.maint (gnulib_snapshot_date): Define.
	(announcement): Use two new announce-gen options,
	--bootstrap-tools and --gnulib-snapshot-date.
	* Makefile.cfg (gnulib_dir): Set.

	Post-release version change.
	* NEWS: Add a line for 6.8-dirty.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Set new version string.

2006-12-07  Jim Meyering  jim@meyering.net

	Version 6.7.
	* NEWS: Record release date.  Remove '-pre' suffix.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Remove version string suffix.

2006-12-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Make the output of "make check" more reproducible.
	* tests/touch/empty-file: Use envvar-check, so "make check" doesn't
	evoke diagnostics like this when COLUMNS=0 in the environment:
	ls: ignoring invalid width in environment variable COLUMNS: 0
	* tests/touch/no-rights: Likewise.
	* tests/help-version: Likewise.
	* tests/uniq/Test.pm: Don't perform the pipe-reading version of test
	118, since it emits "cat: write error: Broken pipe" on some systems.

2006-12-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Document the cp -p fix for special bits.
	* src/copy.c (set_owner): Now returns a three-way result, so
	that the caller can clear the special bits.  All callers changed.
	(copy_reg): Don't set the special bits if chown failed.
	(copy_internal): Likewise.
	* tests/cp/special-bits: Test this fix.

2006-12-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Document the cp --preserve=ownership fix.
	* m4/jm-macros.m4 (coreutils_MACROS): Check for fchmod.
	* src/copy.c (fchmod_or_lchmod): New function.
	(copy_reg): New arg OMITTED_PERMISSIONS.  All uses changed.
	Omit confusing and unused ", dst_mode" arg to 'open' without O_CREAT.
	When creating a file, use O_EXCL, so we're more likely to detect
	funny business by other processes.  At the end, if permissions
	were omitted, chmod them back in.
	(copy_internal): If the ownership might change, omit some permissions
	at first, then restore them after chowning the file.
	* src/cp.c (make_dir_parents_private): Likewise.
	* src/copy.c (cached_umask): New function.
	* src/copy.h (cached_umask): New decl.

2006-12-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Make the output of "make check" more reproducible.
	* tests/misc/date-sec: Don't emit any diagnostic about sleeping.

2006-12-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/install.c (install_file_in_file): Preserve time stamps
	before changing owner or file mode bits, for consistency with
	other coreutils programs.

2006-12-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/date-sec: Output a fixed string.

	* NEWS: du --one-file-system (-x) would skip subdirectories of any
	directory listed as second or subsequent command line argument.
	* tests/du/one-file-system: New file.  Test for today's fts.c fix.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add one-file-system.
	Reported by Mike Frysinger.

2006-12-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/basic: Generate 4KB file simply using printf, rather than
	seq+head.  This avoids a spurious "Broken pipe" diagnostic from seq.

2006-11-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/mv/no-target-dir: Detect a buggy rename syscall.  If found,
	skip this test.  This happens at least on ia64 linux-2.4.19 w/ext3.
	Reported by Matthew Woehlke.

	* tests/mv/dir2dir: Also accept EBUSY.
	Reported by Matthew Woehlke.

2006-11-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (patch-check): Rewrite to diagnose failure.
	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust shred.c offsets.

2006-11-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve the check for departures from C89, and fix the departures
	I found.
	* Makefile.maint (my-distcheck): Also check for C89 compatibility
	as best we can with GCC.
	* src/stat.c (PRINTF_OPTION): Omit comma before } in enum
	declaration; C89 doesn't allow this.
	* src/dcgen: Don't generate string literals longer than
	what C89 requires support for.
	* src/cut.c (usage): Don't use string literals longer than
	what C89 requires support for.

2006-11-26  Mike Frysinger  <vapier@gentoo.org>

	Recognize new archive, audio and image formats.
	Give audio files a separate color.
	* src/dircolors.hin: Add comments for common .sh and .csh scripts.
	Add .bz2, .tbz2, .tz, .rar, .ace, .zoo, .cpio, .7z, .rz as archive
	suffixes.  Add .mng, .pcx, .m2v, .mkv, .ogm, .mp4, .m4v, .mp4v, .vob,
	.qt, .nuv, .wmv, .asf, .rm, .rmvb, .flc, .yuv as image formats.
	Add .aac, .au, .mid, .midi, .mka, .ra as audio suffixes.  Change
	audio color to 00;36 to differentiate from image/video color.

2006-11-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (patch-check): Compile patched sources with
	CFLAGS='-Wdeclaration-after-statement -Werror', to ensure that
	no violations remain.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Remove 3 bogus hunks.

	* src/remove.c (fd_to_subdirp): Remove unused parameter, ds.
	Update callers.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust for changes in rm.c and in remove.c.

	* src/rm.c (main): Remove unnecessary (assuming C99) braces.

2006-11-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Port parts of the code to C89 to minimize the need for c99-to-c89.diff,
	while trying to retain the readability of C99 as much as possible.
	* src/remove.c (rm_1): Remove decl of local, fd_cwd.
	Replace each of two uses with literal AT_FDCWD.
	(cache_stat_init): Return its argument, for convenience.
	Update the caller in remove_dir.
	(AD_pop_and_chdir): Return prev_dir rather than storing through
	a pointer argument.  All uses changed.
	(AD_ensure_initialized): New function.
	(AD_mark_helper): Use it, to avoid the need for declaration
	after statement.
	(rm): Move cycle_check_init call into callee...
	(rm_1): ...here.
	Use an else clause in place of a "continue" statement.
	(close_preserve_errno): Remove.
	(fd_to_subdirp): Rewrite to avoid the need for decl after statement.

2006-11-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove announce-gen from here, too.

2006-11-24  Theodoros V. Kalamatianos  <thkala@softlab.ece.ntua.gr> (tiny change)

	* tests/du/inacc-dest: Skip this test when running as root.

2006-11-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen: Remove file.  It's moving to gnulib.
	* bootstrap: Pull it from gnulib/build-aux instead.
	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Reflect move to ./build-aux.

	* tests/du/deref-args: Use "printf %65536s x" to create a 64KB file,
	rather than a pipeline that would sometimes evoke a diagnostic
	like "seq: write error: Broken pipe".

	* tests/help-version: Suppress dd transfer rate output.

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump to 6.7-pre, not 6.6-pre.

2006-11-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen (print_news_deltas): Fix silly, but harmless typo:
	change "(:?..." to "(?:..." in regexps.

	Post-release version change.
	* NEWS: Add a line for 6.7-pre.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump to 6.7 and add "-pre" suffix.

	Version 6.6.

	* tests/rm/one-file-system: Upon setup failure (e.g., mount failure),
	skip the test rather than failing.  Reported by Michael Deutschmann.

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Use the "(exit N); exit N" idiom,
	rather than just "exit N".

	Arrange for "make check-root" to run the new root-only test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (t7): New target, to run tests/ls/nameless-uid.
	(all_t): Add t7.

2006-11-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Add a root-only test for today's lib/idcache.c fix.
	* tests/ls/nameless-uid: New file.
	* tests/ls/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add nameless-uid.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Add PERL to the list.

2006-11-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/tail-2/assert-2: Mark as a very-expensive test, because I
	find the 7-second sleep annoyingly long.  Besides, this test is
	probably far too specific and timing sensitive ever to trigger again.
	* tests/tail-2/assert: Likewise.

	Post-release version change.
	* NEWS: Add a line for 6.6-pre.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump to 6.6 and add "-pre" suffix.

	Version 6.5.

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Remove "-cvs" suffix from version string.

2006-11-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	ln: creating hard link `f' => `f': No such file or directory
	* src/ln.c (do_link): Give a better diagnostic in this unusual case.
	(do_link): Rename local: s/lstat_ok/dest_lstat_ok/.
	* tests/ln/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-backup.
	* tests/ln/hard-backup: New test for the above.
	* NEWS: Mention this fix.

2006-11-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add sys_stat, since we use it
	directly too.
	* lib/.cvsignore, lib/.gitignore: Add root-dev-ino.c, root-dev-ino.h.
	* m4/.cvsignore, m4/.gitignore: Add root-dev-ino.m4.
	* src/ls.c (DIRED_FPUTS_LITERAL, PUSH_CURRENT_DIRED_POS):

2006-11-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/tail-2/append-only: If chattr +a fails, exit 77 (to tell
	automake we're skipping this test), and give a diagnostic to tell
	the user the same thing.  Reported by Mike Grayson.

2006-11-16  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Replace all optional manpages
	with `$(MAN)', computed at configure time; also, list them ...
	(optional_mans): ... in this new variable.
	(max_aux, EXTRA_DIST): Ensure that we distribute all manpages.

2006-11-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Help valgrind see that there is no leak in dd.c.
	* src/dd.c (dd_copy): Declare real_buf and real_obuf to be static,
	so we need not free them at all.  This is easier than freeing
	both buffers at each of the early "return"s.

	* src/csplit.c (load_buffer): Plug an inconsequential leak.

2006-11-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* .x-po-check: Exclude gl/ files.  Otherwise, po-check would
	complain that some of gl/lib/*.[ch] are not listed in POTFILES.in.

2006-11-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* gl/m4/root-dev-ino.m4: Now that this is part of a real "module",
	remove the now-unnecessary use of AC_LIBSOURCES.

	Adapt to new version of gnulib-tool.
	* gl/modules/root-dev-ino: New file.
	* lib/root-dev-ino.c, lib/root-dev-ino.h: Move these files ...
	* gl/lib/root-dev-ino.c, gl/lib/root-dev-ino.h: ... to here.
	* m4/root-dev-ino.m4: Move this file ...
	* gl/m4/root-dev-ino.m4: ... to here.

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add root-dev-ino.

2006-11-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (insertkey): Use xmemdup, rather than xmalloc+assignment.
	From Paul Eggert.

	Plug another technically-unimportant leak in sort.
	* src/sort.c (main): Don't allocate memory for each new key here.
	(insertkey): Allocate memory for each key here, instead.
	(key_init): Rename from new_key.  Don't allocate.

	* src/sort.c (main): Plug a tiny memory leak.
	Move declaration of local "minus" down to be nearer point of use.

2006-11-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	du would exit early, when encountering an inaccessible directory
	Reported by Mike Frysinger, in
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/8831
	* tests/du/inacc-dest: New test, based on an example from Mike Frysinger.
	* tests/chgrp/no-x: Remove the "fts_read failed: ..."
	diagnostic from the expected output when using native fdopendir.
	* tests/chmod/no-x: Likewise.
	* tests/du/no-x: Likewise.
	* NEWS: Mention this bug fix.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add inacc-dest.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_cast_of_x_alloc_return_value): Add an exclusion
	for xalloc.h itself.

	Avoid false-positive when testing via valgrind.
	* tests/mv/atomic: Grep strace output for a more specific pattern
	than just "unlink", since that got a false positive when testing
	under valgrind: unlink("/tmp/valgrind_proc_9657_cmdline_A51E9991") = 0
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Define EGREP.

2006-10-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (patch-check): Make it easier to regenerate
	the src/c99-to-c89.diff file.  E.g., I do this:
	make patch-check REGEN_PATCH=1; ediff src/c99-to-c89.diff new-diff

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Update to reflect new offsets in rm.c.

2006-10-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (ftello): Add a compile-time check for the highly
	unlikely condition of off_t narrower than long int, rather than
	handling it at run time.  Based on a patch from Paul Eggert.

2006-10-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/chmod/c-option: When double-quoting part of a word, prefer
	to double-quote the whole word.  This is a bit easier to read (at
	least for me), and in some cases it avoids a shell bug with Tru64
	4.0 sh reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe.  For example, instead of
	"$abs_srcdir"/../setgid-check we now write
	"$abs_srcdir/../setgid-check".

2006-10-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Portability to Tru64 V4.0.
	* src/system.h (ftello) [!HAVE_FSEEKO && !defined ftello]:
	Define inline replacement function.
	This (along with a yesterday's fix for autoconf's
	_AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_MACRO_VALUE macro) makes it so coreutils
	now builds once more on Tru64 V4.0.  Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2006-10-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/sample-test: Update copyright year list to include only
	the current year, since this is what I'll want in any new test.

2006-10-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Update to reflect new offsets.

	* NEWS: new feature: rm accepts new option: --one-file-system
	Suggested by Steve McIntyre in <http://bugs.debian.org/392925>.
	* src/remove.h (struct rm_options) [one_file_system]: New member.

	(check-root): Depend on them, rather than executing the five
	commands in a single rule.  Reported by Greg Schafer.

2006-10-23  Bob Proulx  <bob@proulx.com>  (tiny change)

	* Makefile.maint (alpha beta major): Use a better log message for
	the automatic commit of .prev-version.

2006-10-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/pwd-long: Undo last change, since it made Perl invoke
	pwd via a shell.  Instead, ensure that the absolute name of the
	pwd binary consists solely of reasonable characters.
	Whoops.  Don't exec the perl script.  Otherwise, the sh-trap-based
	clean-up code isn't run.

	* NEWS: Add a line for 6.5-cvs.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump to 6.5 and add "-cvs" suffix.

2006-10-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Version 6.4.

	* NEWS: Record the 6.4 release date.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Remove "-cvs" suffix from version string.

	* Makefile.maint: Complete the adaptation to function with a working
	directory that is using git (rather than cvs) for version control.

2006-10-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: (cp --backup fix): Fix a typo.

	* .gitignore: Remove some references to files in subdirectories.
	* build-aux/.gitignore, doc/.gitignore, lib/.gitignore: New files.
	* m4/.gitignore, po/.gitignore, src/.gitignore: Likewise.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Add a comment saying why we prefer
	mknod over mkfifo.

	Enable an fts optimization (call lstat only for directories,
	on some file system types) also with the --preserve-root option
	of chown or chgrp.
	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Compare fts_statp-based
	dev/ino against root dev/ino only for directories.
	(chown_files): Don't let the root_dev_ino setting influence whether
	we use FTS_NOSTAT: fts always sets *fts_statp for a directory.

2006-10-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/od.c (usage): Change description of default to use "-w16",
	not the now-invalid "-w 16" syntax.  From Dan Jacobson.

2006-10-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* bootstrap: Add names to each .gitignore file (if it exists)
	as well as to .cvsignore.

	* Makefile.maint (po-check): This rule didn't detect the new use
	of "gettext" (as opposed to the use of "_" everywhere else) in
	lib/xstrtol.h.  Adjust the grep regexp so that now it does.

2006-10-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Rewrite slightly to avoid duplicate code
	when opening dst_name.
	(copy_reg, copy_internal): Use (SYSCALL != 0) rather than plain
	(SYSCALL) to test for failure in a system call.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Use mknod rather than mkfifo to copy
	a fifo.  This preserves the special mode bits on Solaris 10, which
	is compatible with what Solaris 10 cp -R does.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Remove redundant and confusing local
	variable src_type.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't pass mkdir a mode greater than
	7777.  This matches historical 'cp' behavior and avoids some
	(though not all) implementation-defined behavior of mkdir.
	* src/cp.c (make_dir_parents_private): Likewise.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't pass 'open' a mode greater
	than 777.  This is required by POSIX.  It doesn't make any difference
	in actual behavior on any host that I know of.

2006-10-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dd.c (usage): Use two spaces (not one) to separate the
	"fdatasync" option string from its description, so help2man formats
	the derived man page properly.  Reported by Samuel Thibault
	in <http://bugs.debian.org/393649>.

2006-10-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* .x-sc_trailing_blank: Remove names of files that are no longer
	version-controlled.

2006-10-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/groups.sh (version): Reword message to match the other programs.
	Problem reported by Eric Blake.

2006-10-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (headers_with_interesting_macro_defs): Define.
	(.re-defmac, sc_always_defined_macros): New rules.

	* src/system.h (EXIT_FAILURE, EXIT_SUCCESS): Remove definitions.
	Instead, include "exit.h".  This hereby retires the work-around for
	"Sony NEWS-OS Release 4.0C"'s bug due to "#define EXIT_FAILURE 0".

	* src/cksum.c (uint_fast32_t): Don't define.
	Instead, include <stdint.h>.

	* src/pinky.c (S_IWGRP): Don't define.
	It's already defined by "stat-macros.h" (included via system.h).

	* Makefile.cfg: Remove cruft that's now handled via bootstrap.
	* Makefile.maint: Likewise, remove these targets/rules/variables:
	(local_updates, update, cvs-update, wget_files, get-targets): Remove.
	(cvs_files, wget-update, automake_repo): Likewise.
	Move the comment about cvsu to build-aux/vc-list-files,
	where cvsu is actually used.

	* Makefile.maint (cvs-update): Use $(CVS), not "cvs".

	Work also when the working directory (with e.g. coreutils sources)
	is version controlled with git, rather than CVS.
	* bootstrap (CVS_only_file): Test for the existence of README-cvs,
	rather than CVS.
	In messages and comments, say e.g., "checked-out sources",
	rather than "CVS sources".
	(version_controlled_file): New function.  Work for git as well as
	for CVS.  Don't use grep's -q option.
	(slurp): Call it here, in place of CVS-specific code.

	* NEWS: cp -r --backup dir1 dir2, would rename an existing dir1/dir2
	to dir1/dir2~.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Although we do create a backup of each
	destination directory when in move mode, don't do that when copying.
	Reported by Peter Breitenlohner, in
	<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/8616>.
	* tests/cp/backup-dir: New file.  Test for the above.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add backup-dir.

2006-10-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	More chown/chgrp dereferencing-related fixes.
	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Don't use fts_statp if
	we're dereferencing symlinks.
	Reverse conjuncts, so that we use dereference file_stats
	(aka ent->fts_statp) only *after* we've confirmed that
	chopt->affect_symlink_referent is true.  Otherwise, we might
	use ent->fts_statp uninitialized.
	Don't turn on FTS_NOSTAT when dereferencing symlinks.
	* tests/chown/deref: Update the expected diagnostic, now that
	this test case (trying to use "chown --dereference ..." on a
	dangling symlink) takes a different code path.

2006-10-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Sync from Bison, as follows:

	2006-10-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix problems with translating English-language diagnostics.
	* bootstrap: Fix bug introduced in recent bootstrap changes, with
	respect to bison-runtime pot generation.  The YY_ stuff
	wasn't being captured.

2006-10-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Use fstatat, not stat,
	now that we're using fts_open with FTS_CWDFD.
	* tests/chgrp/posix-H: Add --preserve-root to an invocation of
	chgrp, to exercise the above fix.
	* NEWS: Mention the above.

	* src/du-tests: Clean up a little, though it's still not portable.

	* .vg-suppressions: Add 3 more for debian unstable.

	* tests/ls/Test.pm: Remove long-unused file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add bootstrap.conf.
	Suggestions from Bruno Haible.

2006-10-12  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* Makefile.am (THANKS-to-translators): Add missing $(srcdir).
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Add .kludge-stamp.
	* man/Makefile.am (MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Typo $(dist_man_MANS)
	instead of $(man_MANS).

2006-10-12  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* configure.ac: Avoid compiler warnings about default return
	type in function definitions and unused variables in tests.
	* src/who.c (print_user) [HAVE_UT_HOST]: hostlen is only needed
	if this is #defined.

2006-10-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Reflect s/gl_MACROS/coreutils_MACROS/ renaming.
	Call gl_INIT directly, rather than through the above.

2006-10-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* bootstrap (symlink_to_gnulib): Fix bug: the dot_dots shell
	variable was sometimes used without being initialized.  This
	messed up the installation of the INSTALL file in some cases.

2006-10-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (usage): Correct description of -s, --size.
	It works even without -l.  Suggestion from Karl Berry.

2006-10-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ls.c (quote_name): Use initializer rather than memset to
	initialize an object to zero.  This is easier to read and is less
	likely to introduce a runtime error due to a mixup.  It causes
	gcc -W to issue a warning, but you can work around this by
	appending -Wno-missing-field-initializers.
	* src/pathchk.c (portable_chars_only): Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/stty.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/wc.c (wc): Likewise.

2006-10-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (usage): Mention again that sort fields are origin 1.

	* NEWS: Fix typo: iso-8602 -> iso-8601.  Problem reported by
	Bob Proulx.

	* bootstrap (usage, main program, symlink_to_gnulib): Add option
	--copy.  Inspired by a suggestion from Bruno Haible.

2006-10-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid a compiler warning.
	* src/pathchk.c (portable_chars_only): Initialize variable of type
	mbstate_t via memset, rather than via '{0}'.  Patch from Bruno Haible.

2006-10-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug reported today by Mike Frysinger: mkdir -pv is logging the
	wrong file name in some cases.  Lars Wendler reported a bug in
	my original fix.
	* src/install.c (make_ancestor): New arg COMPONENT.
	* src/mkdir.c (make_ancestor): Likewise.
	* tests/install/basic-1: Check for install -Dv bug.
	* tests/mkdir/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add p-v.
	* tests/mkdir/p-v: New file, to test this bug.

2006-10-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/chgrp.c: Don't include lchown.h; no longer needed.
	* src/chown.c: Likewise.

	* tests/ls/stat-dtype: Use a dynamic test to decide whether the
	current file system has useful d_type info.

	* src/dd.c (flags): noatime and nofollow now depend on
	HAVE_WORKING_O_NOATIME and HAVE_WORKING_O_NOFOLLOW, too.
	(usage): Output info about noatime and nofollow only if
	they are known to work.
	* src/remove.c (AD_push): Inspect HAVE_WORKING_O_NOFOLLOW rather
	than O_NOFOLLOW, when testing whether it's possible to avoid a
	race condition reliably.

2006-10-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Update to reflect new offsets.

	* tests/install/basic-1: Skip the latter part of this test if the
	just-built dd binary is not readable.  Otherwise, this test would fail
	when binaries were created as root.  Reported by Bauke Jan Douma in
	<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/8433>.

2006-10-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/system.h (ST_BLKSIZE): Ceiling at SIZE_MAX / 8 + 1, not at 4
	MiB, since XFS hosts can legitimately have large values of
	st_blksize.  Problem reported by Tony Ernst in
	<http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?17903>.

2006-10-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (nonexistent_file_errno): Remove ENAMETOOLONG.
	Paul Eggert pointed out that the specified file may exist,
	in spite of such an errno value.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Remove ignore-name-too-long.
	* tests/rm/ignore-name-too-long: Remove file.
	* NEWS: Update here, too.

2006-10-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Report failure also if rm is terminated by
	a signal.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Convert two c99'isms -- one in remove.c
	and one in shred.c -- that were added before coreutils-6.3.
	Reported by Michael Deutschmann.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Update to reflect new offsets.

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry): With -f, exit successfully in spite
	of a missing file under some very unusual conditions (with errno
	being any of ENOENT, ENOTDIR, ENAMETOOLONG).

	With --force (-f), rm no longer fails for ENOTDIR.
	* src/remove.c (ignorable_missing): New function.
	Use it everywhere, rather than open-coding the test.
	Andreas Schwab reported the ENOTDIR problem.
	(ignorable_missing): Similarly, don't fail for ENAMETOOLONG.

	* NEWS: Mention the bug fix.
	* tests/rm/ignorable: New file.  Test for the ENOTDIR case.
	* tests/rm/ignore-name-too-long: New file. Test for ENAMETOOLONG.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add the new file names.

	* bootstrap: Undo last change to this file, since now gnulib-tool
	sticks with the automake default in generating dependencies.

	* NEWS: Add a line for 6.4-cvs.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump to 6.4 and add "-cvs" suffix.

2006-09-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Version 6.3.
	* NEWS: Record the 6.3 release date.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Remove "-cvs" suffix from version string.

	* NEWS: Mention Paul's Solaris 8 vs. 10 work-around.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Update offsets.

2006-09-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/rm/readdir-bug: Don't use $(...) in a shell script,
	as it doesn't work with Solaris /bin/sh.

2006-09-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention Paul's fix (to gnulib's canon-host.c) for
	the pinky segfault.

	* tests/seq/basic [neg-2, eq-wid-2]: Comment out tests that
	use .1 as the increment.  Actual output varies too much.
	[eq-wid-3]: New, commented out test.

	* src/shuf.c (read_input): Fix an off-by-one error that
	would cause an infloop for piped input of 8KB or more.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.
	* tests/misc/shuf: Test for the above fix.

	Since any system may be affected by the Darwin readdir bug,
	perform the extra rewinddir unconditionally.  The performance
	impact of rewinding a directory is negligible.
	* src/remove.c (NEED_REWIND): Define to use
	CONSECUTIVE_READDIR_UNLINK_THRESHOLD unconditionally.

	* tests/seq/basic: Use .11 as the upper bound, in case the ".1"
	increment translates to a slightly larger value.
	This corrects a test failure on FreeBSD 6.1 reported by Nelson Beebe.
	The final expected value wasn't being printed.

	Work around a readdir bug in Darwin 7.9.0 (MacOS X 10.3.9) on HFS+
	and NFS, whereby rm would not remove all files in a directory.
	* src/remove.c (CONSECUTIVE_READDIR_UNLINK_THRESHOLD): Reduce to 10.
	(NEED_REWIND): New macro, so that we incur the cost of the work-around
	rewinddir only on afflicted systems.
	* NEWS: Clarify and correct.
	* tests/rm/readdir-bug: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	Prompted by testing and analysis from Bruno Haible:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-09/msg00326.html

2006-09-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Unset BASH_ENV, CDPATH, and ENV, too;
	suggested for Debian stable, which uses Perl 5.8.4.

2006-09-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Automatically generated dependencies are important even
	when all of the sources in a directory come from gnulib.
	* bootstrap (gnulib_tool): Remove the "no-dependencies" automake
	option that gnulib-tool adds to what becomes our lib/gnulib.mk.

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Enable Perl's (-T) taint checking.
	Ensure that IFS is set properly and unset PATH.
	Sanitize inputs.
	Work properly even when the name of the selected file starts with "-".
	Invoke rm via "../../src/rm", and adjust expected output.
	Prompted by a patch from Tim Waugh.

	* README-cvs: Add Bison to the list of required packages.

2006-09-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Update offsets.

	* NEWS: rm works around a bug in Darwin 8.6.1 w/NFS that kept
	it from removing a directory containing 188 or more entries.
	* src/remove.c (CONSECUTIVE_READDIR_UNLINK_THRESHOLD): Decrease by
	20, go work around the buggy readdir on Darwin 8.6.1 with NFS.
	Reported by Matthew Woehlke.

2006-09-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: "groups user" no longer outputs "user :"; you need at least
	two users.  "groups" now processes options like --help more compatibly.
	* src/groups.sh: Implement the option-processing change.
	Handle user and group names with special characters more robustly.
	Report write errors instead of exiting silently with status 1.

2006-09-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: Warn not to run autoreconf manually.  Use bootstrap instead.

	* src/groups.sh: When invoked with 0 or 1 argument, just exec "id".
	Rewrite to avoid using temporary, $status.

	* NEWS: Mention the bug fix.
	* src/groups.sh: Don't hide a write failure.
	Reported by Iain Calder <ic56@rogers.com>.

2006-09-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/chown.c (usage): Clarify --dereference description.
	* src/chgrp.c (usage): Likewise.  Suggestion from Jamie McClelland.

2006-09-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention these fixes.
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): With --verbose (-v), print
	"removed `file_name'" just after unlinking a file.
	(copy_internal): Likewise, in three more places.
	Marc Lehman reported that "touch x; ln x y; mv -v x y" was silent.
	* tests/mv/hard-verbose: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-verbose.

	* tests/help-version (sync_args): Don't call sync, since it spins up
	disks that I've deliberately caused to spin down (but not unmounted).

	* NEWS: Mention the improvement to sort.

	* tests/tail-2/proc-ksyms: Require that /proc/ksyms be readable
	as well as existing.

	* tests/ls/stat-dtype: Don't use tmpfs on linux-2.4 or older,
	since that predated addition of d_type support.

2006-09-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* gl/modules/getloadavg.diff: New file.  Work around the way the latest
	version of the getloadavg module interacts with our bootstrap script.
	* bootstrap (gnulib_tool_options): Add "--local-dir gl".
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Sort file names.
	Add bootstrap and gl/modules/getloadavg.diff

2006-09-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* bootstrap: Add support for --force.
	(usage): New function.  Describe usage less tersely.
	(CVS_only_file): New var.

	* NEWS: Document fix for cp -i and mv -i.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): With -i, prompt even if the source
	is a directory and the destination is not.  This is required by
	POSIX and gives the user a chance to bail out before failing.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add cp-i.
	* tests/cp/cp-i: New file.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add i-5.
	* tests/mv/i-5: New file.

2006-09-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention the chmod bug fix.

	* tests/chmod/inaccessible: New test, specifically for this bug.
	Based on a test case from Paul Eggert.
	* tests/chmod/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add inaccessible.

	Fix the 2006-09-18 bug differently.
	* src/chmod.c: (process_file): Upon FTS_NS for a top-level file,
	tell fts_read to stat the file again, in case it has become
	accessible since the initial fts_open call.
	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Likewise.

	* src/chmod.c: Revert last change.  There is a better way.
	* src/chown-core.c: Likewise.

2006-09-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ln.c (target_directory_operand): Rewrite to avoid porting
	problem on Tandem reported by Matthew Woehlke in
	<https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?17172>.

2006-09-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug where chmod, chown, and chgrp did not process operands
	left-to-right in some cases.
	* src/chmod.c (wd_errno): New var.
	(chmod_file): New function, with most of the contents of the
	old prcess_file function.
	(process_files): Use it.  This gives file names to fts one
	at a time, so that they are processed left-to-right as POSIX
	requires.
	* src/chown-core.c (wd_errno, chown_files): Likewise.
	(chown_file): New function.
	* tests/install/basic-1: Redo test so as to not workaround
	the chmod bug, thereby testing for it.

	* src/shuf.c (main): Quote the entire range when reporting an
	invalid one, rather than just the part that contained the error.

	* tests/stty/row-col-1: Rewrite to avoid temporary file that is
	sometimes left behind if the test is skipped or interrupted.

	* bootstrap (symlink_to_gnulib): New function.
	(cp_mark_as_generated): Use it, to prefer symlinks-to-gnulib
	to copies-of-gnulib.
	(cp_mark_as_generated, slurp, gnulib_files):
	Avoid making a copy if it's the same as the old version.
	(gnulib_files): Add support for this variable (used by Bison).

	* tests/ls/stat-vs-dirent: Fix quoting problem in diagnostic
	indicating flaw in kernel.  Reword to say that the flaw isn't
	serious for coreutils, since the flaw does affect ls -i.

	* tests/chgrp/basic: Fix bug in test case exposed by building on
	Solaris 8 in a setgid directory.  The test case incorrectly
	assumed that 'symlink' would be in group $g1.

2006-09-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Add a line for 6.3-cvs.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump to 6.3 and add "-cvs" suffix.

	Version 6.2.
	* NEWS: Record the 6.2 release date.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Remove "-cvs" suffix from version string.

2006-09-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/chgrp/basic: On an OpenBSD system, rather than failing
	due to a known problem, merely warn about it.
	Rewrite to avoid testing output of chgrp --verbose and chgrp -c.
	Instead, use stat to test file system for desired results, directly.
	* tests/chgrp/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Set host_triplet.

	* tests/envvar-check: Add more variable names to the list of those
	that can affect these programs and tests: _POSIX2_VERSION, COLUMNS,
	QUOTING_STYLE, TABSIZE, TERM, TMPDIR.

2006-09-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Document that mkdir -p and install -d now fork on occasion.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add savewd.
	* src/install.c: Include savewd.h.
	(process_dir): New function.
	(main, install_file_in_file_parents): Use it, along with the new
	savewd module, to avoid some race conditions.
	* src/mkdir.c: Include savewd.h.
	(struct mkdir_options): New members make_ancestor_function, mode,
	mode_bits.
	(make_ancestor): Return 1 if the resulting directory is not readable.
	(process_dir): New function.
	(main): Use it, along with new savewd module, to avoid some
	race conditions.  Fill in new slots of struct mkdir_options, so
	that callees get the values.
	* tests/install/basic-1: Test for coreutils 5.97 bug that was
	fixed in coreutils 6.0, and which should still be fixed with
	this change.
	* tests/mkdir/p-3: Likewise.

2006-09-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add rename-dest-slash.
	The 2006-09-08 changes made it so "mv dir new-name/" would
	fail on NetBSD 1.6.  This makes it work once again.

2006-09-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/mv.c (main): Remove unnecessary (always-true) test for 2 <= n.
	Instead, since it's a little fragile, assert the condition.
	(target_directory_operand): Update comment to reflect latest change.

2006-09-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/who.c (print_user): Rewrite to avoid warning from
	GCC 4.1.1 with -Wall.

2006-09-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/mv/atomic: Check for specific strace output, rather than
	simply nonempty.  RHEL AS 4 would fail this test due to strace
	generating "[ Process PID=14434 runs in 32 bit mode. ]".
	Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2006-09-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): Move new cache_stat_init call onto
	it's own line.
	(rm_1): Move declaration of "st" and new cache_stat_init call
	"down" to nearer where they're used.
	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Add another set of curly braces.

2006-09-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/expr.c (eval6): Fix buffer overrun, or bad performance, if
	substr's last operand is very large.  Performance problem reported
	by Sebastian Kreft.

2006-09-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_prohibit_jm_in_m4): Don't hang when there
	are no .m4 files.
	(sc_require_config_h): Skip this test if there are no version-
	controlled .c files.
	(sc_prohibit_assert_without_use): Likewise.

2006-09-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* bootstrap: Export CVS_RSH separate from its assignment, to work
	even with Solaris 10's /bin/sh.  Suggestion from Mark D. Baushke.

2006-09-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: tail now ignores the -f option if POSIXLY_CORRECT is set,
	no file operand is given, and standard input is any FIFO.
	This is in response to Open Group XCU ERN 114.
	* src/tail.c (main): Likewise.

2006-09-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	mv and "cp -r" no longer fail when invoked with two arguments
	where the first one names a directory and the second name ends in
	a slash and doesn't exist.  E.g., "mv dir B/", for nonexistent B,
	now succeeds, once more. This reverts part of the 2004-06-27
	change for 5.3.0.
	* NEWS: Say the above.
	* src/mv.c (target_directory_operand): Don't require (here)
	that the target operand "look like" a directory.  This change
	pushes the test down to the rename syscall level, where a
	"mv dir existing-non-dir/" will mistakenly succeed on older systems
	that ignore trailing slashes in the rename destination argument.
	* src/cp.c (target_directory_operand): Likewise, but for cp.
	* tests/mv/trailing-slash: Exercise the above fixes.
	* tests/cp/trailing-slash: New file.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add trailing-slash.

	* bootstrap: Use the previously unused variable, $src,
	to avoid repeating "$GNULIB_SRCDIR/$file".

	* bootstrap (cp_mark_as_generated): Don't use "local", to
	accommodate ancient "/bin/sh".  Suggested by Ralf Wildenhues.
	Rename now-global "$src" and "$dst" to have cp_ prefix.
	Safer, and avoids confusion.

	* bootstrap (cp_mark_as_generated): New function.
	(slurp): Use it to prepend editor hints and a warning that
	the file we're copying is generated.
	Suggestion from Bruce Korb.
	(cp_mark_as_generated): Don't add C-style comments for .l or .y files.
	Fix last-minute typo.

2006-09-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* bootstrap: Revert last change.  There are less disruptive ways
	to mark these generated files as read-only.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Update to have proper offsets.

2006-09-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Ensure that some gnulib-tool-generated files are read-only.
	* bootstrap (slurp): Put the body of this function in a sub-shell,
	with "umask a-w" so that all new files are read-only.  Remove each
	file before we write to it, in case it's read-only.
	Make po/Makevars and runtime-po/Makevars read-only, too.

2006-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/cp/acl: Skip this test when cp lacks ACL support.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Set $(CONFIG_HEADER).

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff (remove.c): Adapt one hunk to match the new
	context from change of 2006-09-02.

2006-09-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README-cvs: Fix typo in update command.

2006-09-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Tweak the wording in the new change description so that
	no one can think this change causes e.g., `rm -fr foo../' to fail.

	* tests/rm/inaccessible: Adjust for movement of config.h to lib/.
	Use $CONFIG_HEADER, rather than hard-coding it.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Set $CONFIG_HEADER.

2006-09-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: rm now rejects attempts to remove /, ./, and ../.
	* src/basename.c: Don't include dirname.h, since system.h does it now.
	* src/chmod.c: Likewise.

	* src/su.c: Likewise.
	* src/system.h: Include "dirname.h", since dot_or_dotdot needs it
	now.
	(dot_or_dotdot): Succeed even if "." or ".." is followed by a
	slash.
	* src/rm.c (usage, main): --preserve-root is now the default.
	* src/remove.h: Fix comment.
	* src/remove.c (cache_fstatat, cache_stat_init): New functions.
	(cache_statted, cache_stat_ok): New functions.
	(write_protected_non_symlink): Remove struct stat ** buf_p arg,
	which is no longer needed with the new functions.  All callers
	changed.
	(prompt, is_dir_lstat, remove_entry, remove_dir):
	New struct stat * arg.  All callers changed.
	(write_protected_non_symlink, prompt, is_dir_lstat, remove_entry):
	(remove_cwd_entries, remove_dir, rm_1):
	Use and maintain the file status cache.
	(prompt, remove_entry): Omit the first "directory" in the diagnostic
	"Cannot remove directory `foo': is a directory".  This causes "rm"
	to pass a test case that it would otherwise fail now that it
	"knows" more about its argument.  I think the diagnostic is better
	without the first "directory" anyway.
	(prompt): Remove the no-longer-needed IS_DIR arg; all callers changed.
	(rm_1): Reject attempts to remove /, ./, or ../.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add r-4.
	* tests/rm/r-4: New file.

2006-09-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/stat.c: Include <stddef.h>

	(HAVE_STRUCT_STATXFS_F_FSID___VAL, HAVE_STRUCT_STATXFS_F_FSID_VAL):
	Remove.
	(STRUCT_STATXFS_F_FSID_IS_INTEGER): New macro.
	(FSID_VAL): Remove.
	(print_statfs): If f_fsid isn't an integer, grab its words one
	at a time in little-endian order.  This is a bit easier to configure
	and should avoid a compilation failure on MacOS reported by Bruno
	Haible.

2006-08-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/stat.c (HAVE_STRUCT_STATXFS_F_FSID_VAL, FSID_VAL): New macros, to
	work around a Mac OS X porting problem reported by Bruno Haible in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-08/msg00308.html>.
	(print_statfs): Use them.

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add isapipe.
	* src/tail.c: Include isapipe.h.
	(IS_PIPE_LIKE_FILE_TYPE): Remove.
	(IS_TAILABLE_FILE_TYPE): Just list both FIFOs and sockets as
	tailable, since this seems to be portable.
	(main): Use isapipe, to fix a bug on MacOS X reported by Bruno Haible in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-08/msg00304.html>.

	* src/system.h (LOCALEDIR): Remove, since configmake.h now defines
	it for us.

2006-08-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't test whether macros like
	S_ISLNK are defined, since they're always defined now.
	* src/cp.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/ln.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/ls.c (get_link_name, make_link_name): Likewise.
	* src/mknod.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/mkfifo.c (usage): Likewise.

	Adjust to recent gnulib changes for the gnulib module.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add fcntl.
	* src/system.h (SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END): Remove.  Other code
	is already assuming these macros are defined.
	(O_DIRECT, O_DIRECTORY, O_DSYNC, O_NDELAY, O_NOATIME, O_NONBLOCK):
	(O_NOCTTY, O_NOFOLLOW, O_NOLINKS, O_RSYNC, O_SYNC, O_BINARY, O_TEXT):
	Remove; the fcntl module now handles these.

	Adjust to recent gnulib changes for the inttypes module.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Remove stdint; add inttypes.
	(excluded_files): Don't exclude m4/inttypes-h.m4 or m4/inttypes-pri.m4.

	* src/system.h: Don't bother to include <stdint.h>, since we can
	now assume inttypes.h does the equivalent of including stdint.h.

2006-08-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't make a backup if the last
	component of the source name is "." or "..".
	Reported by Andreas Schwab in http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?17540.
	* NEWS: Mention this.
	* tests/cp/src-base-dot: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add src-base-dot.

	* src/system.h (DOT_OR_DOTDOT): Remove macro.  Rewrite as a...
	(dot_or_dotdot): ...new static inline function.
	* src/remove.c (rm_1): Reflect this renaming.
	* src/ls.c (basename_is_dot_or_dotdot): Likewise.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Add comments.

2006-08-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): Remove -I$(srcdir) and -I../lib,
	since Automake supplies them for us.  It always did -I$(srcdir),
	and with the recent change to AC_CONFIG_HEADERS in configure.ac it
	is now also doing -I../lib.

	* bootstrap (get_translations): Skip this if WGET_COMMAND is empty.
	Fail if the first "echo" fails.  Suppress diagnostics from "ls po/*.po"
	since there might not be any .po files.
	(WGET_COMMAND): Set to empty if wget doesn't
	seem to be available.

2006-08-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	This test was failing in some environments.
	* tests/ls/color-dtype-dir: Don't rely on eval "`dircolors -b`"
	to set LS_COLORS in the environment.
	* tests/envvar-check: Instead, ensure that LS_COLORS is not set.
	Reported by Bob Proulx.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Remove hunk for copy.c; no longer needed.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove these files here, too:
	.x-sc_no_if_have_config_h, .x-sc_prohibit_assert_without_use,
	.x-sc_two_space_separator_in_usage.

	Fix "mv --verbose --backup" so its output includes the
	" (backup: foo.~1~)" suffix also when backing up a directory.
	* NEWS: Report this bug fix.
	* src/copy.c (emit_verbose): New function, factored out of...
	(copy_internal): ...here.  Use the new function.
	* tests/mv/backup-dir: Test for the above fix.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add backup-dir.

2006-08-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* .x-sc_no_if_have_config_h: Remove; no longer needed.
	* .x-sc_prohibit_assert_without_use: Remove; it was empty.
	* .x-sc_two_space_separator_in_usage: Likewise.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_no_have_config_h): Renamed from
	sc_no_if_have_config_h, since it now checks that HAVE_CONFIG_H
	is absent everywhere.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add config-h.
	* src/shred.c: Include <config.h> unconditionally, since
	we now assume config.h exists.
	* src/dircolors.c: Likewise.

2006-08-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	"ls --color" would highlight other-writable and sticky directories
	no differently than regular directories on a file system with
	dirent.d_type support.
	* NEWS: Say the above.
	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): With --color, also stat the file when
	we know it is a directory.
	Derived from an anonymous one-line fix and bug report:
	<http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?15043>.
	* tests/ls/color-dtype-dir: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/ls/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add color-dtype-dir.

2006-08-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* .cvsignore: Remove stamp-h1.  Add coreutils-*, to ignore
	tarballs.
	* bootstrap.conf: Add configmake, verify.
	* src/.cvsignore: Remove localedir.h.
	* src/Makefile.am (localedir, DISTCLEANFILES, localedir.h): Remove;
	subsumed by configmake.
	* src/system.h: Include configmake.h rather than localedir.h
	(LOCALEDIR): New macro.

	Rewrite to avoid some unnecessary casts, macros, literals.
	* src/shred.c (DEFAULT_PASSES, VERBOSE_UPDATE): Now constants,
	not macros.
	(SECTOR_SIZE, SECTOR_MASK): New constants.
	(fillpattern, dopass, do_wipefd, main): Remove unnecessary casts,
	and use the SECTOR_* constants when applicable.  Check for size <
	0 rather than size == -1, since negative-size files are a sign of
	trouble anyway.

2006-08-25  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	* src/shred.c (dopass): Assume a continuable error if EIO even
	if the current position is not a multiple of 512.

2006-08-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (print_statfs): Fix typo: remove extra "sizeof".

2006-08-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/stat.c (HAVE_STRUCT_STATXFS_F_FSID___VAL): Define.  This
	macro was being used without being defined.
	(SB_F_NAMEMAX): Remove cast.
	(f_fsid) [BeOS]: Likewise.
	(OUT_NAMEMAX): Renamed from NAMEMAX_FORMAT, with a new meaning.
	All uses changed.
	(out_string, out_int, out_uint, out_uint_o, out_uint_x): New
	functions.
	(xstrcat): Remove.  All uses changed to use the above functions.
	(print_statfs, print_stat): 2nd arg is now the prefix len, not the
	buffer len.  All uses changed.  Output '?', not '*', for unknown
	data or errors.  Do not assume signed values can be interchanged
	with unsigned when printing.
	(print_statfs): For %i, print the fsid as a single int, not as a
	pair.
	(print_it): Quote invalid format better.

	* NEWS: printf supports the I flag.
	* src/printf.c (print_formatted) [glibc 2.2 or later]: Likewise.

2006-08-23  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	* src/stat.c (STRUCT_STATVFS, statfs, f_fsid, f_blocks, f_bfree) [BeOS]:
	(f_bavail, f_bsize, STATFS_FRSIZE, f_files, f_ffree) [BeOS]:
	(STATXFS_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE_MEMBER_NAME) [BeOS]: Define.

	* src/ls.c (SA_RESTART): Fallback define.

2006-08-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/system.h (EDQUOT): Define if not already defined.
	Problem reported by Bruno Haible for BeOS.

	* .cvsignore: Remove config.h, config.hin, as they are now
	in lib.
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_HEADERS): Move config.h and config.hin
	to lib.
	* src/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): Remove '-I..'; no longer needed.

	* bootstrap (slurp): Define gl_LOCK_EARLY instead of gl_LOCK,
	to accommodate today's gnulib change.

2006-08-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention the sweeping infrastructure changes.

2006-08-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add gnupload.
	* Makefile.maint (emit_upload_commands): gnupload is now
	in build-aux.
	* gnupload: Remove from CVS, since it's now a gnulib module.

	* bootstrap (bootstrap_conf_cleanup): Remove.
	(excluded_files): New var.
	* bootstrap.conf: Likewise.
	* bootstrap (slurp): Exclude files early if they're in the
	excluded_files list.  That way, their names don't get put into
	.cvsignore.

	* aclocal.m4, config.hin, configure:
	Remove from CVS, since ./bootstrap generates them automatically.
	* .cvsignore: Add INSTALL, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config.hin,
	configure, *.cache, *.lineno, *.log.
	Remove more-specific entries.  This catches files like configure.lineno.
	* man/.cvsignore: Add Makefile.in.
	* src/.cvsignore: Add Makefile.in.
	Remove .version, dir.c, install, mvdir, stamp-v, vdir.c, version.c.

	Add Makefile.in.  Sort entries if necessary.  Remove *.I, *.E,
	*.X, *.O, *-tests, build-script, mk-script if they're never
	created in this directory.

2006-08-22  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	BeOS portability.
	* src/uptime.c: Include OS.h if it exists.
	(print_uptime): On BeOS, use the get_system_info function (actually a
	macro). Loop through utmp entries only if utmp.h or utmpx.h exists.
	(uptime): Call read_utmp only if utmp.h or utmpx.h exists.

2006-08-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* .cvsignore: Add ABOUT-NLS.

	Move the check-AUTHORS rule to be run as part of "make distcheck",
	rather than "make check".
	* src/Makefile.am (check): Don't depend on check-AUTHORS; it would
	cause "make check" to fail on systems unable to build all binaries.
	* Makefile.maint (check-AUTHORS): New rule.
	(local-checks-available): Add it here.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.  Needed for BeOS.

2006-08-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/df.c (print_header, show_dev): Use a column width that
	depends on the block size of -P is specified and not autoscaling.
	Problem reported by Gustavo G. Rondina in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-08/msg00164.html

2006-08-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/dircolors/simple (a): Don't fail with an unexpected diagnostic
	when the shell variable, SHELL, is not set.
	Trigger the failure with "(unset SHELL; make check TESTS=simple)".
	Reported by Sven Joachim in <http://bugs.debian.org/355368>.

	* src/od.c: Now that HAVE_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG is no longer defined
	in config.h, change the uses to HAVE_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG_INT.
	Otherwise, on a system with 4-byte longs, "od -t u8" fails with this:
	od: invalid type string `u8';
	this system doesn't provide a 8-byte integral type
	FIXME: add a test for this, but skip it when sizeof uintmax < 8.

2006-08-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Add a bootstrap procedure, so that the CVS version contains fewer
	files and we bootstrap the rest from gnulib, gettext, etc.
	* README-cvs: New file.
	* bootstrap: New file.
	* bootstrap.conf: New file.
	* .x-sc_trailing_blank: Remove config-log, .gdb-history.  Add .po.
	* configure.ac (AC_PREREQ): Move here from m4/*.m4, for benefit
	of gnulib-tool.
	(gl_DEFAULT_POSIX2_VERSION, gl_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS, gl_PERL):
	(gl_IGNORE_UNUSED_LIBRARIES): Remove; now done by gnulib.
	(gl_EARLY): Add.
	(gl_MACROS): Call just after gl_EARLY, just for clarity.
	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Remove patch to ls.c; no longer needed.
	* src/kill.c (strtoimax): Remove decl.
	* src/ls.c: Include "wcwidth.h" instead of rolling it ourselves.
	* src/wc.c: Likewise.
	* src/ls.c (sort_files): Rewrite to avoid need for C99-style
	declaration, so that we don't need to patch this file.
	* src/printf.c (strtoimax, strtoumax): Remove decls.
	* src/su.c: Include getpass.h.
	(getpass): remove.
	* src/system.h: Include mempcpy.h, stpcpy.h, strpbrk.h.
	Include inttypes.h unconditionally.
	(LONGEST_MODIFIER, PRIdMAX, PRIoMAX, PRIuMAX, PRIxMAX): Remove.
	(stpcpy, strndup, strstr, strtoul, mempcpy, CHAR_MIN, CHAR_MAX):

2006-08-20  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* src/stat.c (USE_STATVFS): Reinstate the patch from 2006-08-15;
	the patch from 2006-08-18 broke on cygwin.

2006-08-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Add a line for 6.2-cvs.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump to 6.2 and add "-cvs" suffix.

2006-08-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 6.1.
	* NEWS: Record the 6.1 release date.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Remove "-cvs" suffix from version string.

	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add sparse-file.

	Avoid test failure when `make check' is run through debuild.
	* tests/help-version: Ensure that $SHELL is set to some value
	and exported.  Patch from Sven Joachim.  For details, see
	<http://bugs.debian.org/355368>.

	* tests/ls/stat-dtype: Test for the 2006-08-17 `ls -CF' fix.

	* README: Describe potential "pre-C99 build failure", and work-around.

	Some of my 2006-07-03 changes to tests/*/Makefile.am were being
	backed out due to updates provoked by the copyright changes.
	* tests/Makefile.am.in (PATH): Prepend $(VG_PATH_PREFIX), so that
	it propagates to the derived Makefile.am files.
	($(srcdir)/Makefile.am): Mark generated .am files as read-only,
	so we don't mistakenly edit them again.
	* tests/cut/Makefile.am: Regenerate.

	* tests/wc/Makefile.am: Likewise.

	* NEWS: Fix cp --sparse so that it preserves tail-end sparseness, even
	when the file's apparent size is not a multiple of its block size.
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Don't write a NUL before calling ftruncate.
	For some file sizes, writing that single byte would unnecessarily
	waste a few file blocks.  That write may have been necessary in the
	early days of Linux, but now, removing it should be safe.
	Based on a patch by Alan Curry: <http://bugs.debian.org/370792>
	* tests/cp/sparse: New test for the above.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add sparse.

	* tests/sparse-file: New file, essence factored out of...
	* tests/du/8gb: ... here.  Use the new script.

2006-08-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/system.h (select_plural): Reduce by 1000000, not 1000, since
	the CVS gettext manual now suggests 1000000.

2006-08-18  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	Add support for NetBSD 3.0.
	* src/stat.c (USE_STATVFS): Set to 1 if 'struct statvfs' has a field
	f_fstypename.
	(STATXFS_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE_MEMBER_NAME): Define also if 'struct statvfs'
	has a field f_fstypename.
	This undoes the 2006-08-15 to src/stat.c.

2006-08-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

2006-08-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	ls -CF would misalign columns in some cases.
	* src/ls.c (get_type_indicator): New function.  extracted from...
	(print_type_indicator): ...here.  Use it.
	(length_of_file_name_and_frills): Use it here, too, rather than
	assuming stat.st_mode is valid.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab, here:
	<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/7774>
	See the test for this above. FYI, I did ls -CF /proc and visually
	inspected the result.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal, same_file_ok): Adjust comments not
	to mention the now-removed cp_options.xstat member.

	* Makefile.maint (patch-check): Adapt to work now that the patch
	modifies more than one file in src/.

	With this patch, permit building with Solaris cc on Solaris 7.
	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Add diffs to convert more c99-isms.
	This integrates patches from Bruno Haible.

2006-08-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix some problems reported by Bruno Haible.
	* tests/chmod/setgid (abs_srcdir): Remove; not used or needed.
	Skip this test if "chmod g+s d" silently does nothing.
	* tests/ls-2/tests: Skip this test suite if we can't set up files
	properly for the setuid-etc test.  This simplifies some of the
	hacks we were using to work around porting problems.

2006-08-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/cp/Makefile.am: Don't mark "acl" as XFAIL.
	* tests/cp/acl: Instead, skip the test if either setfacl
	or getfacl fails.
	Reported by Michael Stone.

2006-08-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/lang-default (LC_ALL): Set to "C", so we get
	English-language diagnostics.  Unset the other variables; it
	should be portable to use 'unset' for this stuff nowadays.
	Problem reported by Bruno Haible.  Using "C" reverses the
	2000-10-22 change to fileutils in this area.

	Fix bugs when printing plurals of numbers that are not
	unsigned long int values.
	* src/system.h (select_plural): New function.
	* src/md5sum.c (digest_check): Use select_plural to avoid bug.
	* src/uptime.c (print_uptime): Likewise.
	* src/dd.c (print_stats): Likewise.  Also, don't use ngettext to
	print a floating point number, as reducing to 0 or 1 doesn't work
	for some languages.  Instead, just use "s" for seconds since it
	doesn't need a plural form.

2006-08-16  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	Old versions of gzip would write --help output to stderr, and it
	would be annoying to see that in the output of every "make" command.
	* Makefile.maint (gzip_rsyncable): Throw away stderr output of
	"gzip --help".

2006-08-16  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* tests/cp/acl: Don't use non-portable == operator for test.

2006-08-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ls/stat-dtype: Use stat to test file system type, rather
	than df -T, in case /etc/mtab lies.  Reported by Michael Stone.

2006-08-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Mention that df exits with nonzero status if it generates
	no output.  This change was in 6.0 but inadvertently unmentioned.
	* src/df.c (file_systems_processed): Renamed from n_valid_args, and now
	a boolean.
	(show_dev): Don't set it until we actually output something.
	Print the header if this is the first output.
	(main): Don't print a header, as that is now show_dev's job.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add df.
	* tests/misc/df: New file.

2006-08-15  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* src/stat.c (USE_STATVFS): Define to 0 if f_type is needed, but
	statvfs.f_type not present.  See
	<http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=16325>.

2006-08-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/dd.c (print_stats): Don't substitute "1" for number, as this
	causes confusion for the Hungarian translators.  Problem reported
	by Egmont Koblinger here:
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/7726

2006-08-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* .x-sc_require_config_h: Add lib/at-func.c.

	* NEWS: Add a line for 6.1-cvs.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump to 6.1 and add "-cvs" suffix.

2006-08-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 6.0.
	* NEWS: Record the 6.0 release date.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Remove "-cvs" suffix from version string.

	* TODO: Add an item (convert to use gnulib-tool), add to the plan
	for id-vs-getgrouplist, and remove a few completed items.

	* Makefile.maint (alpha beta major): Fix syntax error.

2006-08-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/shred.c (usage): Don't indent the second line of an item.
	Otherwise, help2man would misformat the output.
	Reported by Adam Buchbinder in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/48917>.

2006-08-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* configure.ac (AM_GNU_GETTEXT): Upgrade to need-formatstring-macros.
	Suggested by Eric Blake to avoid problems like
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-07/msg00087.html>.

2006-08-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ls/stat-vs-dirent: Too many (losing) systems trigger the
	failure that this test checks for (stat/dirent inode mismatch at
	a mount point), so continue to give a diagnostic about the failure,
	but don't actually count it as a failure.

2006-08-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* ABOUT-NLS: Update from gettext 0.15.
	* configure.ac (AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION): Update from 0.13.1 to 0.15.

	* src/csplit.c (struct control): Remove fastmap member.
	(extract_regexp): Allocate fastmap separately, since otherwise
	it might move due to a realloc.  This fixes a bug that led
	to a core dump on 64-bit sparc Solaris 10 (Sun Studio 10).

2006-08-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ls/stat-dtype: If "." is tmpfs, skip this test unless uname -s
	reports "Linux".  This avoids a failure on Solaris 10's tmpfs.
	Redirect both stdout and stderr of df invocations.

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add a TERM directive for each of the following:
	ansi, color-xterm, gnome, konsole, kterm, rxvt-cygwin,
	rxvt-cygwin-native, screen.linux, xterm-256color.
	Sort the TERM directives.
	From Mike Frysinger.

2006-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/dd.c (usage): Warn about oflag=append without conv=notrunc.
	See Debian bug 373736.

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add mlterm, rxvt-unicode; this fixes Debian
	bug 317503.

	* src/.cvsignore: Add shuf.

	* Makefile.maint: Remove the po-update procedure; it doesn't
	work with the new repository on http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/.
	For now I guess we'll have to fix things by hand.
	(do-po-update, po-update): Remove.  All references removed.

	* src/shuf.c (next_line): New function.
	(read_input): Use it, to avoid relying on GCC-specific behavior
	with void * arithmetic.  Problem reported by Bob Proulx.
	* Makefile.maint (my-distcheck): Compile with -Wpointer-arith
	to detect this sort of problem automatically in the future.

2006-08-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c: Add a compile-time check to ensure that filetype
	and filetype_letter have the same number of elements.

	* tests/misc/sort-rand: Remove use of --seed=S.

2006-08-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Add a command 'shuf', and modify shred and sort to use the new
	random number generator library of 'shuf'.

	* AUTHORS: Add shuf.
	* README: Likewise.
	* NEWS: Likewise.  Mention new --random-source option for shred
	and sort.  Move "sort +1 -2" notice to the appropriate section,
	and clarify its role with respect to POSIXLY_CORRECT.
	* man/.cvsignore: Add shuf.1.
	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Add shuf.1.
	(shuf.1): New dependency.
	* man/shuf.x: New file.
	* src/Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Add shuf.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Remove rand-isaac.c.
	(shuf_LDADD): New macro.
	* src/rand-isaac.c: Remove, moving most of its contents to
	lib/rand-isaac.c.
	* src/shuf.c: New file.
	* src/shred.c: Use new random-number interface rather than rand-isaac.c.
	Don't include rand-isaac.c; include randint.h and randread.h instead.
	(RANDOM_SOURCE_OPTION): New enum.
	(long_opts, usage, main): New option --random-source.
	* src/sort.c: Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (struct irand_state, irand_init, irand32, irand_mod): Remove.
	All callers changed to use randint interface.
	(fillrand): Remove.  All callers changed to use randread interface.
	(dopass): Remove dependency on ISAAC buffer size.
	(genpattern): Don't wipe the random state here.
	(randint_source): New static var.
	(clear_random_data): New function.
	(main): Allocate random source, and arrange to wipe it on exit.
	* src/sort.c: Include md5.h, randread.h, xmemxfrm.h.
	(longopts, usage, main): Remove undocumented --seed option;
	it's now replaced by --random-source.
	(rand_state, get_hash): Remove.
	(randread_source): New static var.
	(random_state, cmp_hashes, compare_random): New functions; they guarantee
	no collisions in the random hash function.
	(keycompare): Use compare_random for -R; don't fall back on comparing
	via memcoll, since compare_random does the right thing.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add shuf.
	* tests/misc/shuf: New file.

2006-07-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c (set_author): Preserve the st_author field via the
	file descriptor dest_desc.

2006-07-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: chmod now preserves setuid and setgid bits on directories
	if you use a numeric mode with them clear, e.g., "chmod 755 DIR".

	Fix test case problems if working directory is setgid,
	reported by Bob Proulx.
	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Use symbolic mode so that we clear
	setgid bit more reliably on directories.
	* tests/mkdir/special-1 (set_mode_string): Likewise.

2006-07-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/chgrp.c (usage): Use correct grammar in description of the
	--reference option
	* src/chown.c (usage): Likewise.

2006-07-26  Thomas Schwinge  <tschwinge@gnu.org>  (tiny change)

	* src/copy.c (set_author) [HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_AUTHOR]:
	Correctly access SRC_SB's element ST_AUTHOR.

2006-07-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ls/stat-failed: Adapt to match new expected output.
	From Paul Eggert.

	* src/ls.c (print_color_indicator): Test for S_IFREG first, rather
	than having the code test for all of the other types first.
	Hoist the set-uid/gid-testing code "up" into this new block.
	Classify any other type of file (e.g., S_TYPEISSHM, etc.) as
	C_ORPHAN, not as C_FILE.

2006-07-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Checking in a change from Paul.

	2006-07-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ls.c (DT_INIT): Remove.  All uses removed.
	(enum filetype): Use an ordinary enum rather than trying to keep
	the values in sync with DT_FIFO etc.  That way, we don't have
	to make special assumptions about them.  All uses changed.
	(whiteout): New constant member of enum filetype.
	(filetype_letter): New constant, for use with enum filetype.
	(FILETYPE_INDICATORS): New initializer list.
	(print_dir): Add case for DT_WHT.
	(gobble_file): If stat fails, don't discard information from
	readdir; instead, preserve it so it can be printed.
	(print_long_format): Fall back on readdir result if stat info
	is not available.  Use "?" to denote each unknown mode char,
	instead of an overall "?", since we now know some of the mode
	typically.
	(print_type_indicator): Now that MODE isn't necessarily
	useful, guard all uses.
	Now that two blocks in the type-checking tree can set "type = C_FILE",
	move the suffix-handling code out and down.

2006-07-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Prepare for the above change.
	* src/ls.c [struct fileinfo] (stat_ok): Rename from stat_failed,
	and adjust uses.  From a patch by Paul Eggert.

2006-07-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c: Correct indentation/formatting in a few places.

2006-07-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Use "chmod 0500" rather than "chmod 500".
	Problem report and fix from Bob Proulx.
	* NEWS: Clarify the "chmod 0500" news, and correct the vague
	statements about compatibility with BSD.

2006-07-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): When handling a stat-failed entry,
	print the entry name not the absolute_name -- to be consistent
	with the usual case.
	* tests/ls/stat-failed: Update accordingly.

	* src/ls.c: Add parens around the new uses of ?: ternary operator.

	* src/dircolors.hin: Mention that ORPHAN refers not just to dangling
	symlinks.

	Get --dired offsets right when handling stat-failed entries.
	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Be careful to increment P by the
	appropriate amount, even when inode_number_width and nlink_width
	are zero.
	* tests/ls/stat-failed: Test for the above.

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file) [USE_ACL]: Don't use-uninitialized the
	have_acl member.  That would happen for a directory with both a
	non-stat'able entry and one with an ACL.

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Make it so failure to stat a
	non-command-line file provokes an exit status of 1, not 0.
	Say "cannot access" rather than "cannot stat".
	* tests/ls/stat-failed: New file/test, for the above.
	* tests/ls/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add stat-failed.
	* tests/ls-2/tests (no-a-isdir-b): Update to reflect addition
	of "cannot access " to diagnostic.

	* src/ls.c: Declare stat_failed to be "bool", not "int" everywhere.

	* src/ls.c [enum filetype] (command_line): Remove member.  Not needed.
	Replace all occurrences of "type == command_line" with the
	equivalent, "command_line_arg".

	* src/ls.c: Apply the stat-failed parts of Red Hat's
	coreutils-selinux.patch.  From Ulrich Drepper.
	This makes it so files not mentioned on the command line (e.g.,
	names read from a directory that *is* mentioned on the command
	line) for which stat fails are still listed.  With --color,
	such files are colored just like ORPHANs (aka dangling symlinks).

	* src/df.c (n_valid_args): Declare global to be static.

2006-07-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ls/stat-dtype: Skip this test on reiserfs, since that file
	system lacks d_type support.

2006-07-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* man/chmod.x: Update to reflect recent changes to coreutils.texi.

2006-07-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/su.c (usage): Correct typo in --help output: s/commmand/command/
	Reported by Tim Waugh.
	Also remove the comment duplicating much of --help output.

	* src/ls.c (FILE_TYPE_INDICATOR_OPTION): Reposition this new
	name so the list remains alphabetized.

	Fix another bug: ls --indicator-style=file-type would call
	stat for a symlink, even though it wasn't always needed.
	In some cases, that unnecessary stat would cause ls to fail.
	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Don't treat symlinks specially (in
	requiring a stat syscall).  Remove the offending exclusion.

	* NEWS: Mention the fix.

	* tests/ls/stat-dtype: New file/test, for the above fix.
	Also exercises the new df feature, below.

	* src/df.c (main): Fail and don't print the headers if no
	file system is processed.  This makes it easy to test whether
	a specified directory is on a file system of a given type or types.
	Otherwise, applications would have had to parse df's output.
	E.g., is "." either ext3 or reiserfs: df -t ext3 -t reiserfs .

	Fix a bug: ls --file-type worked like --indicator-style=slash,
	rather than like --indicator-style=file-type.
	* src/ls.c (FILE_TYPE_INDICATOR_OPTION): New enum member.
	(long_options): Map "file-type" to FILE_TYPE_INDICATOR_OPTION,
	not to 'p'.
	(decode_switches): Handle new case: FILE_TYPE_INDICATOR_OPTION.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.
	* tests/ls-2/tests (file-type): New test, for the above fix.

2006-07-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (print_dir): Give a better diagnostic for failed opendir.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add build-aux/vc-list-files.

2006-07-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: chmod, install, and mkdir now leave setgid and setuid bits
	of directories alone unless you specify them explicitly.
	install and mkdir now implement X correctly.
	install now creates parent directories with mode 755, without
	changing their owner or group.
	* src/chmod.c (process_file): Adjust to mode_adjust API change.
	* src/install.c: Include mkancesdirs.h.
	(announce_mkdir, make_ancestor): New functions.
	(DEFAULT_MODE): New macro, specifying initial value of 'mode'.
	(mode): Use it.
	(dir_mode, dir_mode_bits): New vars.
	(main): Set dir modes separately from nondir, so that the X
	op of -m works correctly.
	(main): Remove cwd_errno cruft, since make_dir_parents no longer
	affects cwd.  Adjust to new make_dir_parents API.
	(install_file_in_file_parents): 2nd arg is now char *, not char
	const *.  Use mkancesdirs instead of rolling our own code.
	(change_attributes): Don't worry about AFS, since that kludge
	should not be needed any more.
	* src/mkdir.c (struct mkdir_options): New struct.
	(announce_mkdir, make_ancestor): New functions.
	(main): Use them.  Adjust to mode_adjust API change.  Stick with
	umask 0.  Use make_dir_parents for all the work.
	* src/mkfifo.c (main): Adjust to new mode_adjust API.
	* src/mknod.c (main): Likewise.
	* tests/chmod/setgid: Do the setgid test instead of bailing.
	* tests/mkdir/p-3: Remove re_protect case that no longer applies.
	GNU chmod now behaves like other versions of chmod.
	* tests/mkdir/perm: Add a test for the X bug.

2006-07-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/base64.c (do_decode): Output to parameter OUT, not to stdout.
	This doesn't fix any bugs, since OUT always equals stdout, but it
	makes the code easier to understand.

2006-07-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (CVS_LIST): Use new file, build-aux/vc-list-files,
	rather than open-coding it.  Now supports mercurial, too.
	* .hgignore: New file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .hgignore, which ignores nearly
	all generated files, including ones like configure and po/*.po
	that are currently version-controlled in cvs.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add a few more .??* files.
	They've been in CVS, just haven't been distributed before this.
	Distribute ChangeLog-2005, too.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Add THANKS-to-translators.

2006-07-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/system.h: Assume <dirent.h> exists, since gnulib assumes
	this now as well.

2006-07-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/mv/dir2dir: Adjust so failing with ENOTEMPTY is ok, too.
	That happens with Linux/tmpfs.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add dir2dir.

2006-07-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Adjust to recent updates from gnulib.
	* src/dd.c (apply_translations): Use toupper rather than
	islower followed by toupper; it's simpler and typically
	faster now that we assume at least C89 semantics.  Similarly
	for tolower.
	* src/sort.c (inittables): Likewise.
	* src/expand.c (expand): Don't assume that isprint etc. return
	booleans (needed for pre-C99 hosts).
	* src/fmt.c (check_punctuation): Likewise.
	* src/ptx.c (initialize_regex, fix_output_parameters): Likewise.
	* src/tr.c (is_char_class_member): Likewise.
	* src/unexpand.c (unexpand): Likewise.
	* src/join.c (is_blank): Remove; no longer needed.  All uses
	replaced by isblank (to_uchar (...)).
	* src/pinky.c (create_fullname): Don't assume char is unsigned.
	* src/printf.c (print_esc): Likewise.
	* src/ptx.c (SKIP_NON_WHITE, SKIP_WHITE, SKIP_WHITE_BACKWARDS):
	(copy_unescaped_string): Likewise.
	* src/stat.c (print_it): Likewise.
	* src/system.h (_D_EXACT_NAMELEN): Renamed from NLENGTH, for
	convenience on GNU systems.  All uses changed.  Don't bother
	looking for any dirent.h substitute other than ndir.h.
	(D_INO): Remove unnecessary parentheses.
	(IN_CTYPE_DOMAIN, ISGRAPH, ISPRINT, ISALNUM, ISALPHA):
	(ISCNTRL, ISLOWER, ISPUNCT, ISSPACE, ISUPPER, ISXDIGIT):
	(ISDIGIT_LOCALE, TOLOWER, TOUPPER): Remove.  All uses changed
	to ctype.h equivalents.
	(isblank): Renamed from ISBLANK.  Check for HAVE_DECL_ISBLANK too.
	All uses changed.

2006-07-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/mv/dir2dir: New file, test for 2006-07-05 fix in copy.c.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_the_the): New rule.

	* src/dd.c (skip): Remove one of two adjacent "the"s in a comment.
	* tests/Coreutils.pm (run_tests): Remove one of two adjacent "then"s
	in a comment.

2006-07-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention that mv can now remove an empty destination directory,
	and give an example.  Prompted by a report from Florent Bayle.

2006-07-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (usage): Correct the description of -G: it is useful
	only in a long listing.  Reported by Martin Pool in
	<https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/coreutils/+bug/51653>.

	* man/chmod.x: Correct the description of the sticky bit.  Reported
	by Chris Moore via Ian Jackson in <http://bugs.debian.org/376745>.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't work around old NFS clients like
	SunOS-4.1.4 and Irix 5.3 that set errno to values like EIO and
	ENOTEMPTY upon failed rename.  Otherwise, we risk misinterpreting
	a banal failure as a recursive move-into-self failure.
	Reported by Florent Bayle in <http://bugs.debian.org/376749>.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Regenerate, to remove fuzz.

2006-07-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Plug another unusual leak.
	(AD_mark_helper): Free malloc'd filename if hash_insert says
	that string is already in the hash table.

	The dev/inode of the topmost directory in each hierarchy were not
	being recorded.
	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): Don't call cycle_check here.
	(AD_push): Call it from here instead.

	Fix two small leaks.
	* src/remove.c (AD_stack_clear): New function.
	(rm_1): Use it.
	(AD_pop_and_chdir): Free *prev_dir just before longjmp.

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/*/Makefile.am: (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT):
	Add $VG_PATH_PREFIX as a prefix to $PATH

	* tests/envvar-check (vars): Add CDPATH and POSIXLY_CORRECT.
	* tests/Makefile.am (evar-check): Remove rule.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Remove .env-warn.
	* tests/.env-warn: Remove file.  No longer used.
	Suggestion from Eric Blake.

2006-07-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/system.h: Include <stdint.h> unconditionally, since we
	now assume the stdint module.

2006-07-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: With no operand, 'tail -f' now silently ignores the '-f'
	only if standard input is a FIFO or pipe and POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.
	* src/tail.c (main): Implement this.
	* tests/tail/Test.pm (f-pipe-1): Renamed from f-1.
	(test_vector): Set POSIXLY_CORRECT for the f-pipe-* tests.

2006-07-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ln.c (do_link): Use new, shorter URL, for ag-review link.

	* .x-sc_require_config_h: Add ^lib/xstrtold\.c$, so make distcheck
	passes once again.

2006-06-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: seq now uses long double internally rather than double.
	It now defaults to a minimal fixed point format if possible.
	It lets you use %a, %A, %E, %F, %G.
	* src/Makefile.am (seq_LDADD): Remove $(SEQ_LIBM); add $(POW_LIB).
	* src/seq.c: Don't include <math.h> or <xstrtol.h>; no longer needed.
	(isfinite) [!defined isfinite]: New macro.
	(separator, terminator): Now points to const.
	(first, step, last): Remove.
	(usage): Update to match new behavior.
	(struct operand, operand): New type.
	(scan_arg): Renamed from scan_double_arg, since we no longer use double.
	All uses changed.
	Compute and return a value of type operand, not double.
	(long_double_format): Renamed from valid_format, and now returns a
	new format with an "L" added if needed, if the original format was
	valid.  Allow %a, %A, %E, %F, and %G formats.
	(print_numbers): Take numeric values as args rather than from globals.
	Print long double, not double.
	(get_width_format): Remove.
	(get_default_format): New function.
	(main): Implement new way of calculating default format.
	Don't worry about locale's representation of the decimal point, since
	the arguments are always processed in the C locale.
	* tests/seq/basic (neg-2): Adjust to new default format.
	(eq-wid-1, eq-wid-2): Resurrect these tests, since the new
	implementation should do the right thing.

2006-06-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/stty/basic-1: Work around an intermittent test failure
	on HP-UX 11.11.  Report and analysis from Bob Proulx.
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/7475

2006-06-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Support obsolete usages like "sort +1 -2" even when
	conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001, since this is a pure extension to
	POSIX.  Problem reported by Christian in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-06/msg00220.html
	* src/sort.c (main): Implement this.

	* src/system.h (CLOSEDIR): Remove.  All uses changed to closedir.
	Autoconf 2.60 says this stuff was obsolete.

2006-06-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Regenerate, to remove fuzz.

2006-06-28  Bob Proulx  <bob@proulx.com>  (tiny change)

	* tests/mv/i-link-no: Work around HP-UX /bin/sh tracing problem
	(set -x when VERBOSE=yes) when stderr is redirected before stdout
	causing shell tracing of the stdout redirection to be written to
	the stderr file.  Avoid problem and test failure on HP-UX by
	redirecting stderr last.
	* tests/dd/unblock-sync: Order shell file redirections for
	stderr and stdout in the common style.
	tests/acl: Likewise.

2006-06-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/cat-proc: Try to avoid any spurious numeric
	differences in frequently-changing /proc/cpuinfo.
	Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2006-06-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Attempt rmdir (actually, unlinkat-with-AT_REMOVEDIR) upon any
	fd_to_subdirp failure, not just when errno == EACCES.
	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): Use unlinkat-with-AT_REMOVEDIR, not
	rmdir, here, even though rmdir may happen to be adequate.

	* NEWS: rm no longer fails to remove an empty, unreadable directory
	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): If we can't open a directory,
	and the failure is not being ignored, try to remove the directory
	with rmdir (aka unlinkat-with-AT_REMOVEDIR), in case it's empty.
	Problem report and test case from Paul Eggert in
	<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/7425>.

	* tests/rm/empty-inacc: New test, for the above.

	Avoid a segfault for wc --files0=- < /dev/null.
	* src/wc.c (compute_number_width): Return right away if nfiles == 0.

2006-06-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: wc accepts a new option --files0-from=FILE, where FILE
	contains a list of NUL-separated file names.

	* src/wc.c: Include "readtokens.h".
	(usage): Describe the new option, and adjust the `Usage':
	with this option, no FILE may be specified on the command line.
	(main): Handle the new option.
	* tests/misc/wc-files0: New tests, for the above.
	* tests/misc/wc-files0-from: Likewise.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add wc-files0.

2006-06-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/md5sum.c (DIGEST_BUFFER): Remove now-unused definitions.

2006-06-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tee.c (tee_files): Rename from tee, to avoid conflict with
	the function in glibc's <fcntl.h>.  Reported by Andreas Schwab.

2006-06-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.cfg (local-checks-to-skip): Add changelog-check,
	so this check is not run as part of "make distcheck".

2006-06-18  Bob Proulx  <bob@proulx.com>  (tiny change)

	* tests/misc/pwd-long: Fix typo (s/neq/ne/) in previous change.

2006-06-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/pwd-long: Make error output a little clearer.

2006-06-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/inaccessible: Skip this test on systems without openat
	support.  Reported by Bob Proulx.

2006-06-15  Bob Proulx  <bob@proulx.com>  (tiny change)

	* tests/misc/mknod: Improve permission checks to handle
	running mkdir test in set-gid directories.

2006-06-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/basic: Revamp not to hard-code file system block sizes.

2006-06-12  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Pass $(PERL), for
	files0-from test.

2006-06-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* .gitignore: New file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .gitignore.

	Setting TIME_STYLE=long-iso in the environment would make the
	cp/same-file test fail.
	* tests/envvar-check (vars): Add TIME_STYLE to the list.
	* tests/cp/same-file: Revert last change.
	Source the envvar-check script, to ensure that TIME_STYLE
	settings don't affect these tests.

2006-06-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/cp/same-file: Execute 'ls' in the C locale, so that it
	uses POSIX time stamp formats.  Problem reported by John Nixon in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-06/msg00062.html>.

2006-06-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention the AIX-strndup-bug vs. dircolors workaround.

	Require a "Version N.M" line at the top of the ChangeLog
	file only when making the actual release, not when running
	"make distcheck".
	* Makefile.maint (maintainer-distcheck): Don't depend on
	changelog-check.
	(alpha beta major): Depend on it here, instead.

2006-06-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Ensure that cat works with any of the options, -A -v -e -E -T,
	when applied to files in /proc and /sys, even when the FIONREAD
	ioctl produces nonsensical results.  Before this change, cat would
	produce no output (or truncated output), for some linux kernels.

	* src/cat.c (write_pending): New function, factored out of cat.
	(cat): Also interpret a negative ioctl/FIONREAD count as indicating
	that there are bytes to read.  Some versions of linux-2.6.16 do that.
	Write any pending output before returning.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson in <http://bugs.debian.org/370583>.
	* NEWS: Mention this bug fix.
	* tests/misc/cat-proc: New file.  Test for the above.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add cat-proc.

2006-06-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/expr.c (eval4): Detect overflow properly when multiplying
	INTMAX_MIN * -1.

2006-06-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: The 'expr' command now detects and reports integer overflow.
	(It would be better to use extended precision instead, but that
	would be more work.)
	* src/expr.c (integer_overflow): New function.
	(eval4, eval3): Check for integer overflow.

2006-06-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix problems when building with Solaris/SVR4/etc. make, which uses a
	different and somewhat bogus implementation of VPATH.  In the
	directory tests/misc, rename tests whose names might appear in the
	Automake-generated rules.  For example, we can't use a test named
	'test', since Automake generates a rule that contains the text
	"if test -f ./$$tst; ...", and this might expand to something like
	"if ../../../coreutils-6.0/tests/misc/test -f ./$$test; ...",
	which executes the 'test' script rather than the 'test' command.
	* tests/misc/false-status: Renamed from tests/misc/false.
	* tests/misc/pwd-long: Renamed from tests/misc/pwd.
	* tests/misc/sort-merge: Renamed from tests/misc/sort.
	($prog): Set to 'sort' rather than to $PROG.
	* tests/misc/test-diag: Renamed from tests/misc/test.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (PROG): Take the basename of $$tst,
	in case Solaris make has prepended the directory.
	(TESTS): Adjust to above renamings.
	* tests/misc/expand: Don't assign to PROG; no longer needed
	now that Makefile.am sets PROG to the basename.
	* tests/misc/fold: Likewise.

2006-06-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Make `cp --link --no-dereference' work also on systems where the
	link system call cannot create a hard link to a symbolic link.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal) [LINK_FOLLOWS_SYMLINKS]: Don't use
	the link syscall on a symlink when it would do the wrong thing.
	Based on the patch by Aurelien Jarno: <http://bugs.debian.org/329451>
	* tests/cp/link-no-deref: New file/test for the above.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add link-no-deref.
	* NEWS: Mention the change (doesn't affect Linux).

2006-06-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix some porting problems in the test cases reported by
	Ralf Wildenhues for HP-UX 11.23 in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-05/msg00238.html
	* tests/help-version: Don't assume that \< \> works in sed.
	* tests/misc/close-stdout: Don't assume that >&- works.
	Add a /dev/full test.
	* tests/touch/no-create-missing: Don't assume that >&- works.

2006-05-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (usage): Add `v' to the list of sorting-related options.
	From Justin Pryzby.

2006-05-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/cp/fail-perm: source lang-default.
	* tests/rm/inaccessible: Likewise.

2006-05-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/inaccessible: AIX 4.3.3 gives a different diagnostic.
	Recognize it, too.  Reported by Ralf Wildenhues, in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-05/msg00192.html

2006-05-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/chgrp.c: Support new options: --preserve-root and
	--no-preserve-root.  Somehow this program was skipped when those
	options were added to chown, chmod, and rm.  Reported by
	vaqflabuopac@spammotel.com in <http://bugs.debian.org/365656>.
	* NEWS: Mention this.

2006-05-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Remove mention of --seed.  We'll replace it with something
	better, and don't want to indicate that it is supported.
	* src/sort.c (usage): Likewise.

2006-05-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/chmod.c (main): Use FTS_PHYSICAL here, too.

	* src/du.c (main): Rename local, s/symlink_deref_bit/symlink_deref_bits/
	and arrange for -D to set fts' FTS_PHYSICAL bit as well as
	FTS_COMFOLLOW.  Spotted by Justin Pryzby.

	* gnupload: Merge changes from automake, retaining the ""--to...
	kludge to placate overzealous `make distcheck' check.

2006-05-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (main): Don't let -D, -L, or -P turn off the internal
	FTS_TIGHT_CYCLE_CHECK directory traversal option.
	Reported by Justin Pryzby in http://bugs.debian.org/367691

2006-05-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c (usage): Correct description of -a: s/-dpR/-dpPR/.
	From Tomas Pospisek.

2006-05-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/mv/no-target-dir: Test two more cases.

2006-05-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	mv -T DIR EMPTY_DIR no longer fails unconditionally
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't manually prohibit a move where
	the destination is an existing directory.  Sometimes doing that is
	valid.  Let the rename system call enforce the rules.  That is
	allowed only when the source is a directory and the destination
	directory (to be replaced) is empty.  Reported by Eric Blake.
	* tests/mv/no-target-dir: New file/test for this.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add no-target-dir.
	* NEWS: Mention this.

	* tests/mv/atomic: New file/test for yesterday's fix.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add atomic.

	* tests/du/long-sloop: Avoid harmless `ambiguous redirect' diagnostic.

2006-05-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't explicitly unlink the destination
	when moving a symlink into the place of an existing non-directory.
	Reported by Joshua Hudson.
	* NEWS: mention this.

2006-05-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (patch-check): Fail if patch generates any output,
	even merely for changed offsets.

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Adjust to reflect new offsets.

	* NEWS: Mention changes affecting df, pwd, shred.

2006-05-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ls/stat-vs-dirent: New test, to detect the bogus file
	system condition where dirent.d_ino != stat.st_ino.
	* tests/ls/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add stat-vs-dirent.

2006-05-06  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* tests/ls/inode: Expand to test inode from readdir case.
	* tests/ls/follow-slink: Expand to test broken links encountered
	implicitly, favoring Solaris 9 and OpenBSD 3.4 behavior.

2006-05-06  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* tests/mv/leak-fd: Work even on case-insensitive file system.

2006-05-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention the 2006-03-19 pwd-related change that makes
	lib/getcwd.c work around inconsistent file system dirent.d_ino data.

2006-05-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (DEFINE_SORT_FUNCTIONS, LIST_SORTFUNCTION_VARIANTS):
	Use better macro parameter names: s/basename/key_name/,
	s/basefunc/key_cmp_func.  Fix typo in comment.

2006-04-29  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* src/ls.c (main): On systems with d_type, directories_first only
	implies format_needs_type, not format_needs_stat.

2006-05-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (xstrcoll_df_version, rev_xstrcoll_df_version): Add space
	after comma in arg list, from Eric Blake.

2006-04-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/misc/date (relative-3): New test, derived from a bug
	report by John Thomas McDole.

2006-04-23  Francesco Montorsi  <fr_m@hotmail.com>

	New option for ls: --group-directories-first.
	It makes ls list directories before files.
	* NEWS [New features]: Mention it.
	* src/ls.c (sort_type): Rearrange to use as an array index when
	choosing sort function; added new sort_numtypes member for
	compile-time check.
	(time_type): Add new time_numtypes member for compile-time check.
	(directories_first): New global variable.
	(GROUP_DIRECTORIES_FIRST_OPTION): New enum.
	(long_options): Add --directories-first.
	(main): Support new option.
	(is_directory): New function.
	(extract_dirs_from_files): Use it.
	(DIRFIRST_CHECK, DEFINE_SORT_FUNCTIONS)
	(LIST_SORTFUNCTION_VARIANTS): New macros.
	(sort_functions): New global variable.
	(sort_files): Use it.
	(usage): Document new option.

2006-04-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/shred.c (fillrand): The assertion was way too weak, due to
	what must be a typo.  Strengthen it to its intended value.
	(dopass): Don't use alloca; it's not worth the aggravation here,
	since it's used only to get a page-aligned buffer, and page
	alignment doesn't buy us much here.  I'm suspicious that alloca
	causes problems on some hosts, due to a recent bug report by Adam
	Waltman: http://bugs.gentoo.org/130246.

2006-04-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Add new programs, base64, sha224sum, sha256sum,
	sha384sum, sha512sum.

2006-04-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/chmod.c (describe_change): Adjust to filemode changes.
	* src/ls.c (HAVE_ST_DM_MODE): Remove; moved to ../lib/filemode.c.
	(print_long_format): Use (new) filemodestring rather than
	(old) mode_string, so that we get more file types right, at least
	in theory.  Adjust to filemode changes.
	* src/stat.c (human_access): Likewise.

2006-04-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ptx.c (main) [DEFAULT_IGNORE_FILE]: Remove code to use a default
	ignore file.  This has never been enabled.  Reported by Eric Blake.

2006-04-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ln.c (linkfunc): Remove.  This method ran into a compiler/linker
	bug in Interix.  Just call symlink or link directly.  All uses changed.
	* src/setuidgid.c (main) [! HAVE_SETGROUPS]: Don't call setgroups.
	* src/stat.c (USE_STATVFS): New macro.
	Include <sys/statvfs.h> and use statvfs only if USE_STATVFS.
	(NAMEMAX_FORMAT): define a bit more clearly, now that the
	statvfs-using code is a bit more regular.
	* src/system.h (sync) [!HAVE_SYNC]: New macro.

2006-04-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: csplit, nl, expr now conform to POSIX better, and are
	more-compatible with traditional Unix, with respect to regular
	expressions.
	* src/csplit.c (extract_regexp): Set re_syntax_options to a
	value that is compatible with what POSIX requires.
	* src/nl.c (build_type_arg): Likewise.
	* src/expr.c (docolon): Likewise.  Also, don't let anchors match
	newline; this fixes an incompatibility with tradition and with POSIX.
	Don't warn about leading ^.  POSIX says it is unspecified whether
	^ is a special character, which means that implementations can
	either treat it as special or not, but either way a warning is not
	allowed (unless the regexp is otherwise invalid).  Instead, anchor
	the expression but treat ^ as an anchor; this is the traditional
	behavior (e.g., Solaris 10).
	(eval4, eval3, eval2): Treat non-numeric args, division by zero,
	and the like as invalid expressions (exit status 2), not as
	failure of 'expr' (exit status 3).  This is more consistent with
	how Solaris behaves.
	* tests/expr/basic (fail-a): Adjust exit status to match new expr
	behavior, for status 2 versus 3.
	(anchor): New test.
	(bre1, bre2, bre3, bre4, bre5, bre6, bre7, bre8, bre9, bre10):
	(bre11, bre12, bre13, bre14, bre15, bre16, bre17, bre18, bre19, bre20):
	(bre21, bre22, bre23, bre24, bre25, bre26, bre27, bre28, bre29, bre30):
	(bre31, bre32, bre33, bre34, bre35, bre36, bre37, bre38, bre39, bre40):
	(bre41, bre42, bre43, bre44, bre45, bre46, bre47, bre48, bre49, bre50):
	(bre51, bre52, bre53, bre54, bre55, bre56, bre57, bre58, bre59, bre60):
	(bre61, bre62): New tests.
	* tests/misc/csplit: Use \{...\} in test RE, to test that we're
	conforming to POSIX.

	Port to Solaris 8.
	* tests/du/long-from-unreachable: Solaris 8 sh doesn't understand
	"if !".  Do not assume that 'sed' can handle long, newline-free input.
	* tests/du/long-sloop: Likewise.  Evaluate expr once, not $n times.

2006-04-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Adjust to new regex.h API (with new fastmap type), and clean
	up the regex storage allocation a bit.

	* src/csplit.c (struct control): Put re_compiled member at the
	end, since it's large.  Change regexpr member from char * to bool;
	all uses changed.  Add new member fastmap.
	(extract_regexp): regexp arg is now char const *, not char *.
	Don't bother duplicating the regular expression; it's not needed.
	Set fastmap from new fastmap member.  Don't bother allocating
	a buffer, as the regexp code does a better job than we do.
	* src/expr.c (docolon): Allocate and use a fastmap.
	Don't bother allocating a buffer.
	* src/nl.c (body_fastmap, header_fastmap, footer_fastmap):
	New vars.
	(build_type_arg): New fastmap arg.  All uses changed.
	Don't bother allocating a buffer, but set a fastmap.
	* src/ptx.c (context_regex_string, word_regex_string): Remove.
	(context_regex, word_regex): New vars, replacing the above.
	All uses changed.
	(struct regex_data): New type.
	(compile_regex): Renamed from alloc_and_compile_regex, since
	we no longer allocate storage.  Arg is now a struct regex_data *,
	not a const char *.  All uses changed.  Don't allocate the fastmap;
	instead, take it from the caller.  Don't convert size_t to int,
	to avoid arithmetic overflow problems.  Don't bother freeing
	storage afterwards; it's not worth the aggravation.
	* src/tac.c (compiled_separator_fastmap): New ver.
	(main): Use it.  Don't bother allocating a buffer.

2006-03-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dd.c (iwrite): Remove assignment without effect.
	Reported by Felix Rauch Valenti.

2006-03-22  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	including fixed behavior for //.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Sort.  Add basename, dirname.

	* src/shred.c (wipename): Likewise.
	* src/split.c (next_file_name): Likewise.
	* src/su.c (log_su, run_shell): Likewise.

2006-03-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: nohup diagnostics are now more precise, and nohup now
	redirects stderr to nohup.out if stdout is closed and stderr is a tty.
	* src/nohup.c (main): Implement this.
	* tests/misc/nohup: Test the new behavior.

2006-03-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (set_author): Rename function, from preserve_author.

	* src/remove.c (AD_pop_and_chdir): Use new macro,
	CYCLE_CHECK_REFLECT_CHDIR_UP, rather than open-coding it.

	* src/system.h (SAME_INODE): Remove definition.
	Include "same-inode.h", instead.

2006-03-11  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* src/pwd.c (robust_getcwd): Prepend only one slash, not two.

2006-03-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Fix a bug whereby a user with write access to a directory being removed
	could cause the removal of that directory to fail with an erroneous
	diagnostic about a directory cycle.  Reported by Vineet Chadha.

	* NEWS: Mention this.
	* src/remove.c (AD_pop_and_chdir): If the directory we're about to
	leave (and try to rmdir) is the one whose dev_ino is being used to
	detect a cycle, reset cycle_check_state.dev_ino to that of the parent.

2006-03-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Document dd's new 'directory' and 'nolinks' flags.
	* src/dd.c (set_fd_flags): Handle file-creation flags on file
	descriptors, rather than ignoring them.
	* tests/dd/misc: Add test cases for append, nofollow, directory,
	and nolinks flags.  Simplify redirection to /dev/null in some cases.

	* tests/dd/misc: iflags->iflag.  This fixes a typo that meant the
	noatime test never tested anything.

2006-03-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/dd.c (flags, usage): New flags directory, nolinks.
	* src/system.h (O_NOLINKS): Define to 0 if not already defined.

	* src/ls.c (usage): Mention that -f disables --color.
	Problem reported by Niels MÃ¶ller.

2006-03-03  Justin Pryzby  <pryzbyj@justinpryzby.com>

	* man/*.x: Add references to syscalls from utilities of the same name.

2006-03-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/help-version: Set SHELL, if not already set, in order to
	avoid failure when `make check' is run through debuild;  dircolors
	would fail due to lack of $SHELL.  Reported by Sven Joachim.

	Make `base64 --wrap=N' work for N=0, and for N larger than SIZE_MAX.
	* src/base64.c (wrap_write, do_encode, main): Change type of
	parameters and locals, wrap_column, form size_t to uintmax_t.
	(main): Adjust to use xstrtoumax, accordingly.

2006-03-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't fail when run from an environment with SHELL not a Bourne
	shell, e.g. `env SHELL=/bin/csh make check' would fail this test.
	* tests/dircolors/simple: Invoke each non-failing test with -b.
	Reported by Michael Stone.

2006-02-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/base64: Derive --decode-using tests from the
	encode-based ones.

	Split lines to stay within 80 columns.

	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add base64.
	* tests/misc/base64: Test base64.  From Simon Josefsson.

	* src/base64.c (do_decode): Use correct type for parameter,
	ignore_garbage: s/size_t/bool/.

	* src/base64.c: Don't include .h files already included by system.h:
	<string.h>, <stdlib.h>, <stdbool.h>, <limits.h>, <errno.h>.
	Include "system.h" before the other lib/*.h header files.
	Include <sys/types.h> before "system.h".
	(wrap_write): Remove declaration of unused local, initial_column.
	(wrap_write): Correct declaration syntax: s/size_t * V/size_t *V/.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (join invocation): Mention `sort -k 1b,1'.
	* src/join.c (usage): Likewise.
	Documentation problem reported by Philip Kensche.

2006-02-20  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* man/rm.x: Update documentation to match previous patch.

2006-02-18  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	instead of a basename.
	(main): New -I option, new behavior to --interactive.
	* tests/rm/interactive-once: New tests.
	* tests/rm/interactive-always: Ditto.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Run them.

2006-02-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_two_space_separator_in_usage): Make the regular
	expression match more of the target lines, e.g., those that start with
	`-S,' (short option followed by a comma) or that include `=[...]'.
	Patch by Nicolas FranÃ§ois.
	Fix the four offenders thus exposed:
	* src/join.c (usage): Use two spaces (not one) to separate the
	--first-only option string from its description, so help2man formats
	the derived man page properly.
	* src/pr.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (usage): Likewise.

2006-02-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* INSTALL: Update from gnulib.

2006-02-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (patch-check): New target.
	(local-checks-available): Add to the list.

2006-02-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: New file.
	* src/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add c99-to-c89.diff.

	* .x-po-check: New file, with exclusions so that `make distcheck'
	passes once again.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-po-check.

	rm -r must remove an empty directory, even if it is inaccessible.
	* src/remove.c (close_preserve_errno): New function.
	(fd_to_subdirp): Don't print a diagnostic in this function.
	Do it from the callers instead, unless rmdir succeeds.
	(remove_cwd_entries, remove_dir): Adjust callers.
	* tests/rm/empty-inacc: New test for the above.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add empty-inacc.
	* NEWS: Mention this bug fix.
	* tests/rm/rm2: Adjust two expected diagnostics, now that they're
	a tiny bit less precise: cannot remove `a/1': ... instead of
	cannot open directory `a/1': ...

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check-rules): Automatically derive this
	list of sc_-prefixed rule names.

2006-02-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* Makefile.maint (CVS_LIST): Don't assume cvsu is available.
	(CVS_LIST_EXCEPT): New macro, to simplify exception-processing.
	Most uses of CVS_LIST changed to use CVS_LIST_EXCEPT.
	(syntax-check-rules): Bring back sc_changelong.  (Hmm, why did it
	go away? was that an accident?)
	(sc_cast_of_argument_to_free, sc_cast_of_x_alloc_return_value):
	(sc_cast_of_alloca_return_value, sc_space_tab, sc_prohibit_atoi_atof):
	(sc_error_exit_success, sc_file_system, sc_no_if_have_config_h):

	(sc_useless_cpp_parens, makefile-check, m4-check, po-check):
	(author_mark_check, makefile_path_separator_check):
	Output line numbers, to simplify navigation of Emacs *compilation*
	buffers.
	(sc_prohibit_atoi_atof, sc_file_system):
	Rework slightly so that Makefile.maint doesn't get reported as a
	violation of its own syntax rules.
	(sc_dd_max_sym_length): Use ifneq to do nothing, instead of doing
	it at run-time (which didn't work with Bison).  Fix a makefile typo,
	caught by Makefile.maint itself: spaces where a tab should be.
	(po-check): Check lib/*.[ch] even if not in CVS; used by Bison,
	which copies from ../gnulib/lib/*.[ch] to lib/*.[ch].
	Ignore djgpp and man subdirectories, to avoid false matches with
	Bison and coreutils, respectively.  Use sort -u to remove the
	resulting duplicates.
	* gnupload: Rework slightly to avoid bogus warning from
	sc_two_space_separator_in_usage.

2006-02-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Use gzip's --rsyncable option only if it's available.
	* Makefile.maint (gzip_rsyncable): New variable.
	(GZIP_ENV): Use it.

2006-02-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (local-checks-available): Define in terms of
	the expansion, $(syntax-check-rules), rather than the single,
	top-level target `syntax-check', so that it's easier to exclude
	individual rules (via $(local-checks-to-skip)).
	(tgz-md5, tgz-sha1, ...): Remove now-unused definitions.

2006-02-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (!defined O_DIRECT): If O_DIRECTIO is defined (as it
	is on Tru64), define O_DIRECT to that.  Patch From James Lemley.

	* tests/help-version (expected_failure_status_vdir):
	Redirect an expected disk-full diagnostic to /dev/null.

2006-02-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/unexpand.c (usage): Use two spaces (not one) to separate the
	--first-only option string from its description, so help2man formats
	the derived man page properly.
	* src/rm.c (usage): Likewise for --no-preserve-root.
	* src/chown.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/chgrp.c (usage): Likewise.

	derived man page properly.
	* src/mv.c (usage): Likewise.
	Patch from Nicolas FranÃ§ois in http://bugs.debian.org/351601.

2006-02-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): cp -RL would fail when encountering
	the same directory more than once in the hierarchy beneath a single
	command-line argument.  That is legitimate, e.g. when there are
	two or more symbolic links, each pointing to some directory that
	would not otherwise be copied.  Reported by Christophe LYON.
	* tests/cp/cp-deref: New file.  Test for today's fix.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add cp-deref.
	* NEWS: Document this.

2006-02-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Require automake-1.9.6, not 1.8.3.

2006-02-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/od.c (usage): Mention that -t a ignores high order bit.
	Documentation problem reported by Ed Avis.

2006-02-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pwd.c (find_dir_entry): Remove unused local, `ent_sb_valid'.

2006-01-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/head.c (main): Use a better diagnostic when someone uses a
	trailing numeric option in an invalid way.  Problem reported by
	Karl Berry.
	* src/tail.c (parse_options): Likewise.

2006-01-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/wc.x: Include `count' keyword in man page synopsis,
	per suggestion from http://bugs.debian.org/181585.

2006-01-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/df.c (show_dev): If the file system claims to have
	more available than total blocks, report the number of used
	blocks as being total - available (a negative number) rather
	than as garbage.  Problem reported by Toralf Foerster.

2006-01-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tail.c (tail_forever): Don't exit-nonzero when an attempt
	to put a regular file in O_NONBLOCK mode fails with EPERM.
	That happens on Linux (up to 2.6.15) when using tail -f on a file with
	the append-only attribute.  Reported by Dean Gaudet.  For details,
	see http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=15473.
	* NEWS: Mention this fix.
	* tests/tail-2/append-only: New file.  Test for the above.
	* tests/tail-2/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add append-only.
	* tests/Makefile.am (check-root): Add tail-2/append-only

2006-01-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention fts-related improvements and bug fixes.

2006-01-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/fmt/basic (pfx-1, pfx-2): New tests, to demonstrate the bug
	reported as http://bugs.debian.org/147577.  Forwarded by Thomas Hood.

2006-01-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add long-from-unreadable.

2006-01-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Now that fts no longer changes the current working directory, adjust
	its clients accordingly -- note that du.c uses fts but doesn't need
	any adjustment, since it doesn't operate on the actual files,
	but rather just uses the stat buffers provided by fts.

	* src/chown-core.c: Include "openat.h".
	Don't include "lchown.h".
	(restricted_chown): Accept a new parameter, CWD_FD, and use it in
	calling openat, lchownat, chownat, rather than open, lchown, chown.
	Update caller.
	* src/chmod.c: Include "openat.h".
	(process_file): Use chmodat (fts->fts_cwd_fd,... in place of chmod (...

	* tests/du/long-from-unreadable: New test, to exercise one small
	corner of fts.c.

2006-01-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add comments discouraging the
	addition of new directories under tests/.

	* tests/acl: Redirect stdin to /dev/null.  Otherwise, FreeBSD 5.0's
	getfacl would hang.

2006-01-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/long-sloop: Adjust not to hard-code the expected
	diagnostic corresponding to ELOOP.  Solaris' diagnostic differs
	from that of GNU libc.  Reported by Paul Eggert.

	* tests/du/long-sloop: Create file at end of symlink chain.

	* tests/misc/test: New file, with a test for one of the
	bugs fixed by yesterday's test.c changes.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add test.

2006-01-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/long-sloop: New file.  Test for today's fts.c bug fix.
	That bug could make du -L, chgrp -L, or chown -L fail to diagnose
	a very long sequence of symbolic links (not necessarily a loop).
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add long-sloop.

2006-01-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/test.c (test_syntax_error): Append a newline.  All callers
	changed, except for the ones that didn't already append a newline.
	Bug reported by Eric Blake.

2006-01-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (X2NREALLOC): Now that verify_true is no longer
	void, cast its result to void, to avoid gcc's warning that
	``left-hand operand of comma expression has no effect''.
	(DECIMAL_DIGIT_ACCUMULATE, X2REALLOC): Likewise.

2006-01-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/chmod/no-x: Add a test for today's fts.c fix.

2006-01-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>  (tiny change)

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Use DTTOIF only if it's defined.
	This is necessary for Dragonfly.  Patch by Joerg Sonnenberger.

2006-01-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/system.h (X2NREALLOC, X2REALLOC, DECIMAL_DIGIT_ACCUMULATE):
	Use verify_true instead of verify_expr, to sync with gnulib.

2006-01-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/date.c (usage): Adjust the formatting of the entries for
	%::z and %:::z (separate with two spaces, not one) so that help2man
	formats them properly.  Reported by Philip Rowlands.

2006-01-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* configure.ac (gl_IGNORE_UNUSED_LIBRARIES): Add.

2006-01-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (copyright-check): Use date +%Y in place of
	hard-coded 2005.

	* src/remove.c (rm_1): Remove `static' attribute on local `status'.
	First off, the attribute should have been `volatile' (not static)
	to avoid longjmp-related risk of clobber.  Secondly, now there is
	no longer any risk of a local variable being clobbered, so there's
	no need for any attribute at all.

2006-01-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c: Give a few functions the inline attribute.
	(AD_pop_and_chdir): Use gotos to avoid some duplication.
	(AD_push): Rewrite an assertion so that the entire computation
	goes away when assertions are turned off.

	* src/tail.c (ENOSYS) [!defined ENOSYS]: Don't define here.
	It's already defined in "system.h".
	* Makefile.maint: Add a FIXME comment.

2006-01-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* ChangeLog: Remove entries from 2005-10-22 and earlier.
	* ChangeLog-2005: New file, for entries up to version 5.92.

2006-01-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/no-x: Also allow a slightly different diagnostic -- the
	one you get when using openat-enabled fts.c and du (coming soon).
	* tests/chmod/no-x: Likewise.
	* tests/chgrp/no-x: Likewise.

	* src/system.h (O_DIRECTORY) [!defined O_DIRECTORY]: Define.

2006-01-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/chown-core.c (RC_do_ordinary_chown): New enum value.
	(restricted_chown): Return it, if the file cannot be accessed due
	to EPERM, or if no uid or gid are required, or if the file is
	neither a directory nor a regular file.  Rewrite to avoid gotos.
	(change_file_owner): Handle RC_do_ordinary_chown case.
	Rewrite to avoid gotos.
	* tests/chgrp/basic: Make sure we can change the group of
	inaccessible files.

	* src/date.c (usage): Explain %g, %G, and %V a bit better.

2006-01-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (set_owner): Correct a comment.

	* src/tail.c (parse_options): Change warning to say that --retry
	is useful `mainly' (not `only') when following by name.
	Reported here: http://bugs.debian.org/273781

2006-01-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Document that mkfifo and mknod -m no longer set special bits.
	* src/copy.c: Include lchmod.h.
	(copy_internal): Use lchmod rather than chmod.
	* src/cp.c: Include lchmod.h.
	(re_protect, make_dir_parents_private): Use lchmod rather than chmod.
	* src/mkdir.c: Include lchmod.h.
	(usage): Clarify -m's operation.
	(main): Use lchmod rather than chmod.  Don't use lchmod unless the
	new mode contains bits outside the 777 range.
	* src/mkfifo.c (usage): Clarify -m's operation.
	(main): If -m is given, don't invoke chmod; use umask 0 instead.
	Report an error if -m asks for bits outside the 777 range.
	* src/mknod.c (usage, main): Likewise.

	* src/mkdir.c, src/mkfifo.c, src/mknod.c: Undo 2005-12-19 changes.

2005-12-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_obsolete_symbols): Prohibit use of O_NDELAY.
	(sc_prohibit_assert_without_use): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it to the list.
	* .x-sc_prohibit_assert_without_use: New empty file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add it.

	* Makefile.maint (CVS_LIST): Define in terms of $(srcdir).

	* cp.c, df.c, link.c, mknod.c, nice.c, sleep.c, unlink.c:
	Don't include <assert.h>; it wasn't used.

2005-12-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/chown-core.c (restricted_chown):
	Don't try O_WRONLY unless O_RDONLY failed wth EACCES.
	* src/remove.c (fd_to_subdirp): Open with O_DIRECTORY | O_NOCTTY
	| O_NOFOLLOW too, for consistency with other dir-openers.
	Use POSIX-preferred O_NONBLOCK rather than O_NDELAY.
	(is_empty_dir): Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (wipename): Likewise.  Don't bother trying to open
	dir for writing, since POSIX prohibits it.

2005-12-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/help-version: Redirect stderr to /dev/full, to suppress
	write error diagnostic.

2005-12-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/mkdir.c, src/mknod.c, src/mkfifo.c (main)
	Avoid a minor race condition when `-m MODE' is specified, by using
	open, fchown, and close rather than just chown.  To do that reliably --
	even with an overly restrictive umask -- ensure that each mkdir,
	mknod and mkfifo call uses a mode including at least owner-read access.
	* src/mknod.c (main): When `-m MODE' is specified, exit nonzero if
	the subsequent chown (or equivalent open,fchown,close) fails.
	* tests/misc/mknod: New tests.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add mknod.

2005-12-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (is_empty_dir): Open with O_NDELAY, so we don't hang,
	e.g., on a named pipe.
	(OPEN_NO_FOLLOW_SYMLINK): Remove definition.  Use O_NOFOLLOW in
	place of all uses, since it is guaranteed (system.h) to be defined.

2005-12-05  Andreas Gruenbacher  <agruen@suse.de>

	Add POSIX ACL support
	* src/ls.c: Switch back from HAVE_ACL to USE_ACL: The acl() syscall
	is no requirement for ACL support; particularly, it does not exist
	on systems that have POSIX ACLs.
	* src/copy.h (cp_option_init) [umask_kill]: Remove member.
	* src/cp.c (umask_kill): With default acls, the umask is not to be
	applied.  Remove umask_kill, don't change the process umask, and let
	the kernel apply the umask where appropriate.
	* src/cp.c (make_dir_parents_private): Fix logic for POSIX ACLs.
	* src/copy.c (get_dest_mode): Remove; it is obsolete after removing
	umask_kill.
	(copy_reg, copy_internal): Use copy_acl and set_acl
	instead of fchown/chown. Fix the logic for POSIX ACLs.
	(chown_succeded): Remove; we now always copy acls and
	preserve S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and S_ISVTX when needed, no matter if we
	did a chown before or not.
	* src/mv.c, src/install.c (cp_option_init): Don't set umask_kill member.
	* src/Makefile.am (dir_LDADD, ls_LDADD, vdir_LDADD, cp_LDADD,
	mv_LDADD, ginstall_LDADD): On systems with an ACL library, arrange
	to link with it via $(LIB_ACL), for the utilities that need it.

2005-12-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/remove.c (OPENAT_CWD_RESTORE__REQUIRE): Remove.
	(OPENAT_CWD_RESTORE__ALLOW_FAILURE): Likewise.
	(fd_to_subdirp): Remove openat_cwd_restore_allow_failure arg; its
	value is now signified by whether cwd_errno is null.
	(fd_to_subdirp, remove_dir, rm_1); Change cwd failure indicator from
	pointer-to-bool to pointer-to-errno-value.  All callers changed.
	(rm_1): Don't bother setting a local cwd failure flag and then
	ORing it into the caller's.  Just set the caller's.
	(rm): Use cwd failure errno value to print a slightly-better
	diagnostic.

2005-12-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (print_it): Properly handle a backslash at the
	end of a --printf format string.  Reported by Paul Eggert.
	* tests/misc/stat-printf (end-bs): Add a test for the above.

2005-12-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/acl: Port to pre-POSIX shells like Solaris 8 /bin/sh.
	Don't assume /etc/passwd contains user names; use 'id' instead.

2005-12-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	stat: revert behavior of --format=FMT (-c)
	stat: add new option: --printf=FMT
	* NEWS: Mention this.
	* src/stat.c (isodigit, octtobin, hextobin): Define.
	(PRINTF_OPTION): Define.
	(interpret_backslash_escapes, trailing_delim): New globals.
	(usage): Document them.  Alphabetize on long option names.
	(print_esc_char): New function.
	(print_it): Rewrite, in order to handle backslash escapes.
	(main): Handle new option.  Set globals for --format, too.

	* tests/misc/stat-printf: Test --printf and --format.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add stat-printf.

2005-12-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: sort now reports incompatible options.
	* src/sort.c (incompatible_options, check_ordering_compatibility):
	New functions.
	(main): Use them.  Don't bother with a usage message for
	"sort -c a b", for consistency with other error diagnostics.
	* tests/sort/Test.pm (incompat1, incompat2, incompat3, incompat4):
	New tests.

	* src/cat.c (main): Undo previous change.  close_stdout already
	does the check, so the previous change wasn't necessary.

2005-12-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/cat.c (main): Check for close (STDOUT_FILENO) failure.

2005-12-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Install a more-conservative approach for sort -R.  It's the
	same basic idea as the existing code, except it uses the full ISAAC
	approach (called the "more kosher" approach in the existing comments).
	This makes "sort -R" quite a bit slower (about a factor of 2 on my
	little tests involving 10000 lines on a 2.4 GHz P4), but I think it's
	better to be conservative here at first, and review any performance
	improvements carefully.
	* .x-sc_require_config_h: Add src/rand-isaac.c.
	* src/rand-isaac.h: Remove.  All uses now simply include rand-isaac.c.
	* src/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Remove rand-isaac.h.
	(shred_SOURCES, sort_SOURCES): Remove.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add rand-isaac.c.
	* src/rand-isaac.c: Revert to what used to be in shred.c, without
	changing it to allow for varying numbers of words in the state.
	Alter so that we include rand-isaac.c directly rather than
	compiling it and linking to it.  Don't include config.h or
	system.h; that's the includer's responsibility.
	Omit functions that are specific to shred.
	(ISAAC_LOG, ISAAC_WORDS, ISAAC_BYTES, struct isaac_state, ind):
	(isaac_step, struct irand_state):
	Resurrect these, with the same defns that used to be in shred.c.
	(ISAAC_SIZE, isaac_new, isaac_copy): Remove.
	(isaac_refill, isaac_seed_start, isaac_seed_data, irand_init, irand32):
	static again.
	(struct isaac_state, isaac_refill, isaac_mix, isaac_init):
	(isaac_seed_start, isaac_seed_data, isaac_seed_finish, isaac_seed):
	(irand_init, irand32, irand_mod):
	Number of words is constant again.
	(struct irand_state, irand_init, irand32, irand_mod): Move to shred.c.
	* src/shred.c: Include rand-isaac.c rather than rand-isaac.h.
	* src/sort.c: Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (fillrand, dopass, main): Undo previous change.
	(struct irand_state, irand_init, irand32, irand_mod): Moved back here,
	from rand-isaac.c.
	* src/sort.c: Don't include md5.h; it wasn't needed.
	(struct keyfield): Rename random_hash to random, for consistency
	with the other member names.  All uses changed.
	(usage): Tweak wording to mention STRING for --seed option.
	(short_options): Rorder for consistency with other programs.
	(rand_state): Now a struct, not a pointer to one.  All uses changed.
	(HASH_WORDS, HASH_SIZE): Remove.
	(get_hash): Remove comments around resbuf size, since we can assume C89.
	Use a "more-kosher" (but slower) approach of invoking isaac_refill.
	(keycompare): Adjust to the new get_hash.
	Add a FIXME.
	(badfieldspec): Omit recently-introduced comment; it isn't needed.
	(main): Don't set need_random simply because gkey has it set; that
	doesn't necessarily mean we'll need random numbers.
	Redo seeding to match new get_hash approach.

2005-12-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Add rand-isaac.h.

	Avoid shred segfault on 64-bit systems.
	* src/rand-isaac.c (isaac_refill): Don't try to negate a
	local of type uint32_t.  Make the local an `int' instead.

	* NEWS: Mention sort's new options.

	* src/rand-isaac.c (isaac_mix): Declare to be static.
	Mark all other functions as `extern' so the tight-scope
	part of `make distcheck' passes once again.
	* src/rand-isaac.h (isaac_mix): Remove declaration.

	* src/sort.c (get_hash): Change position of `*' in parameter
	type to conform with convention.
	(main): Split a long line so it fits in 80 columns.
	(keycompare): Remove stray SPACE before TAB that was
	causing `make distcheck' to fail.

	* src/shred.c: Don't include gethrxtime.h.  No longer needed.

	* tests/misc/sort-rand: New file: basic tests for the new options.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add sort-rand.

2005-12-10  Frederik Eaton  <frederik@ofb.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (sort_LDADD): Add $(LIB_GETHRXTIME).
	(shred_SOURCES, sort_SOURCES): New macros, so we compile rand-isaac.c.
	* src/rand-isaac.c: New file, containing ISAAC code that was in shred.c.
	Make state size runtime-configurable.
	(isaac_new, isaac_copy): New functions.
	* src/rand-isaac.h: New file.
	* src/shred.c: Include rand-isaac.h.  Move ISAAC code to rand-isaac.c.
	(fillrand, main): Adjust to the fact that the state size is now
	runtime-configurable.
	* src/sort.c (short_options, long_options, WORDS, keycompare, main):
	(usage): Add options --random-sort and --seed to implement a random
	shuffle.
	Include md5.h and rand-isaac.h.
	(get_hash): New function.
	(rand_state): New var.
	(HASH_WORDS, HASH_SIZE): New macros.

2005-12-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/test.c (main): Fix misleading comment.

2005-12-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Mention dd's new noatime flag.
	* src/system.h (O_NOATIME): Define to 0 if not already defined.
	* src/dd.c (flags, usage): Add support for noatime flag.

2005-12-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Distribute the cvsu script, used only by `make syntax-check'.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add build-aux/cvsu.
	* Makefile.maint (CVS_LIST): Use build-aux/cvsu, now that we
	distribute a copy of this script.
	* .x-sc_unmarked_diagnostics: Add build-aux/cvsu.

	* tests/mv/acl: exit-77 before the trap, not after, if we fail
	to create a temporary directory on another partition.
	From Andreas Gruenbacher.

2005-12-06  Tomas Pospisek  <tpo@sourcepole.ch>  (tiny change)

	* man/basename.x: Cross-reference to dirname and readlink.
	* man/dirname.x: Cross-reference to basename and readlink.

2005-12-05  Andreas Gruenbacher

	* src/copy.c [!HAVE_FCHOWN]: Define fchown(...) to -1.
	(set_owner, preserve_author): New functions, factored out of copy_reg.
	(copy_reg): Use them.
	(copy_internal): Use them here, too.

2005-12-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sleep.c (usage): Say what happens with two or more arguments.
	Suggested by Justin Pryzby.

	where it's used.

2005-12-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/rm.c (long_opts): Change the name of each undocumented, for-
	testing-only option to start with `-', so that it cannot render
	ambiguous any prefix it happens to share with some other option name.
	Problem reported by Eric Blake.
	* src/head.c (long_options): Likewise.
	* src/tail.c (long_options): Likewise.

	* tests/misc/head-elide-tail: Update uses of undocumented, for-
	testing-only --presume* options to start with `---'.
	* tests/rm/dangling-symlink: Likewise.
	* tests/rm/dir-no-w: Likewise.
	* tests/rm/isatty: Likewise.

2005-11-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint: Add a comment about cvsu.

2005-11-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: df updates for "none", "proc", inaccessible file systems.
	* src/df.c (show_point): Ignore inaccessible file systems.
	(usage): -a includes dummy file systems, not size-0 file systems.

	* src/od.c (unsigned_long_long_int): Renamed from ulonglong_t,
	to avoid collision with POSIX name space.  All uses changed.

2005-11-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add acl to the list.
	* tests/acl: Add `$0: ' prefix to diagnostics.

	* .x-sc_require_config_h: Add lib/buffer-lcm.c to the list.

2005-11-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c: Improve performance a bit by optimizing away
	unnecessary system calls and going to a block size of at least
	8192 (on normal hosts, anyway).  This improved performance 5% on my
	Debian stable host (2.4.27 kernel, x86, copying from root
	ext3 file system to itself).
	Include "buffer-lcm.h".
	(copy_reg): Omit last argument.  All callers changed.
	Use xmalloc to allocate rather than trusting alloca
	(which is unwise with large block sizes).
	Declare locals more locally, if possible.
	Use uintptr_t words instead of int words, for a bit more speed
	when looking for null blocks on 64-bit hosts.
	Optimize away reads of zero bytes on regular files.
	In the typical case, insist on 8 KiB buffers, at least.
	Avoid unnecessary extra call to fstat when checking for sparse files.
	Avoid now-unnecessary cast to off_t, and "0L".
	Avoid unnecessary test of *new_dst when checking for same owner
	and group.

2005-11-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/remove.c (rm): Don't assume C99 for-loop syntax.

2005-11-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (AD_push): Remove debugging cruft.

	* tests/rm/unread2 (rm): Change expected diagnostic,
	`cannot open directory' to `cannot remove', to align with
	new version of rm.
	* tests/rm/rm2: Ensure that rm now continues removing entries
	even after certain types of failure.

	* src/remove.c: Rewrite.  Now, this module is reentrant on systems
	that provide openat (Solaris), and on systems like Linux+procfs
	where our openat emulation code is reentrant.  This also fixes a
	few low-probability leaks and eliminates some code that could,
	in very unusual circumstances, cause rm() (via a callee) to exit.
	* NEWS: Mention this.

	* configure.ac: Put copyright dates all on one line so the
	emacs function that updates them works properly.

2005-11-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* configure.ac (AM_PROG_CC_C_O): Add.  Needed for CVS Automake.
	Problem reported by Eric Blake.
	(AC_PROG_CC_STDC): Use this instead of AC_PROG_CC, so that
	we get a standard-conforming compiler.  This relies on the new
	m4/c.m4 file.  Note that it's a bit tricky, since c.m4 doesn't
	define AC_PROG_CC_STDC; we are relying on Autoconf 2.59 internals.
	m4/c.m4 can go away with Autoconf 2.60 comes out.

2005-11-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (AD_mark_helper): Make a `char *' parameter `const'.
	(AD_mark_current_as_unremovable): Likewise, but for a local.
	(rm_1): Likewise.

	* tests/mv/acl: Let traps handle removing temporary directories.

	Expect acl-related tests to fail, until the corresponding
	patches are committed.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Add acl.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Likewise.

	ACL tests, from Andreas Gruenbacher.
	* tests/acl, tests/mv/acl, tests/cp/acl: New files.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add acl.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add acl.

	* src/ls.c (basename_is_dot_or_dotdot): Correct wording in comment.

2005-11-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Improve quality of ln's diagnostics.
	* src/ln.c (do_link, usage): Likewise.
	(do_link): Don't use alloca on a buffer of unbounded size.

2005-11-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Accommodate HPUX.  It appears to fail
	with EACCES rather than EPERM.  Reported by Peter O'Gorman here:
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/5766
	This also affects AIX 4.3.3, according to Ralf Wildenhues, in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-05/msg00192.html

2005-11-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS (sort): Mention consequences of today's mkstemp-safer.c fix.

2005-11-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen: Accept new option, --gpg-key-id=ID and
	emit a blurb telling how to use the .sig files.
	* Makefile.cfg (gpg_key_ID): Define.
	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Use new option and key.

	Require that most .c files include <config.h>.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_require_config_h): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.
	* .x-sc_require_config_h: New file listing exceptions to the
	above rule.  Some are legit, others are simply grandfathered in.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_require_config_h here, too.

2005-11-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/checksum.h, src/md5.c, src/sha1sum.c: Remove now-unused files.

2005-11-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention `readlink -f' bug fix in 5.3.0 news.
	Mention new readlink options in 5.3.0's `New features' section.
	Spotted by Thomas Hood.

2005-11-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Merge in changes from b5_9x branch.

2005-11-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: ls now defaults to --time-style='locale', which in turn acts
	like --time-style='posix-long-iso' if the locale settings are messed up.
	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): Implement this.

2005-11-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/2g: s/expensive/very expensive/ in a comment.
	From Paul Townsend.

2005-10-17  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* src/ls.c (usage): Fix descriptions of --sort, --time.
	Reported by Vitaly A. Ostanin.

2005-11-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ln.c: Include filenamecat.c.
	(FILE_BASENAME_CONCAT): Remove.
	(do_link): Remove last arg DEST_IS_DIR.  All callers changed.
	(main): Use file_name_concat, base_name, and strip_trailing_slashes
	instead of FILE_BASENAME_CONCAT.  This simplifies the code, and avoids
	the use of alloca.

2005-11-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (process_file): Don't overflow for files of size >= 2^31
	on systems with stat.st_blocks of a signed 32-bit type.
	This bug causes trouble on some AIX 5.1 systems.
	Report and trivial patch from Paul Townsend:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2005-11/msg00033.html>
	* NEWS: Mention this.

	* tests/du/2g: New (very-expensive) test for the above-fixed bug.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it here.
	* tests/very-expensive: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add it here.
	* tests/cp/perm: Mark this test as `very-expensive', too.

2005-11-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Mention that rm -d and maybe ln -d are scheduled for
	removal in 2006.
	* src/remove.h (struct rm_options): Remove unlink_dirs.  All uses
	removed.
	* src/rm.c (usage): Don't mention rm -d.

2005-11-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/dd/skip-seek: Fix typo in comment: s/fileutils/coreutils.
	From Andreas Schwab.

	* tests/dd/unblock-sync: Redirect stderr to /dev/null so the
	`M+N records in/out' lines don't pollute `make check' output.

	* tests/dd/skip-seek (sk-seek4): New test, to exercise the bug
	fixed on 2005-10-31.  This test uses the new, IN_PIPE specifier.
	* tests/Coreutils.pm: Accept a new type of input specifier: IN_PIPE,
	to indicate that the input file should be piped into the command
	under test (via `cat FILE | $prog ...').

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry): Emit a better diagnostic when rm
	(without -r) fails to remove a directory on a non-Linux system.
	This change affects only newer Solaris systems (with priv_*
	functions like priv_allocset).  Reported by Keith Thompson.

	* tests/rm/dir-nonrecur: New file/test for the above fix.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add dir-nonrecur.

2005-11-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: "tail -c 2 FILE" and "touch 0101000000" now operate as
	POSIX 1002.1-2001 requires.
	* src/tail.c (parse_obsolete_option): Implement this.
	Problem reported by Vincent Lefevre.
	* src/touch.c (main): Pass PDS_PRE_2000 to posixtime.
	* tests/tail/Test.pm (c-2, c-2-minus, c2, c2-minus): New tests.
	(test_vector): Add special cases for _POSIX2_VERSION, and
	regularize the old ones a bit.
	* tests/touch/obsolescent: Add y2000 test.

2005-10-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/dd.c (skip): Fix off-by-one error reported by
	Theodoros V. Kalamatianos.

2005-10-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/mkdir/p-3: Require that the test be run as non-root.
	Problem and trivial fix reported by Theodoros V. Kalamatianos.

2005-10-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ln.c (FILE_BASENAME_CONCAT): Omit unnecessary slashes in the
	boundary between DEST and SOURCE in the result.

2005-10-26  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	* src/md5sum.c (main) [!O_BINARY]: Changed default read mode
	back to text, to sync with documentation and for backwards
	compatibility.

2005-10-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/dircolors/simple (other-wr): Add an explicit test for
	the dircolors bug (NULL-dereference) fixed yesterday.

2005-10-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tac.c (tac_file): When determining whether a file is seekable,
	also test whether it is a tty.  Using only the lseek-based test would
	give a false positive on Solaris.  Reported by Peter Fales.

2005-10-24  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	* tests/install/d-slashdot: New test, for "install -d" failure.
	* tests/install/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add d-slashdot.
	* tests/mkdir/p-slashdot: New test, for "mkdir -p" failure.
	* tests/mkdir/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add p-slashdot.

2005-10-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dircolors.c (ls_codes): Add missing comma.
	Anonymous report and patch from
	http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=14849

	* src/dircolors.c: Add compile-time assertion that the slack_codes
	and ls_codes arrays have the same number of elements.  This would
	have prevented the above-fixed bug.

	* src/expand.c (parse_tab_stops): Add a comment to make this function
	identical to the one in unexpand.c.
	* src/unexpand.c (parse_tab_stops): Adjust syntax to make this function
	identical to the one in expand.c.

	* src/expand.c (next_file): Don't assume fopen cannot return stdin.

2005-10-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/md5sum.c (digest_check, main): Use ptr_align rather than
	a dangerous pointer-value-to-`unsigned' cast.
	* NEWS: mention the new sha* programs.
	* AUTHORS: Add new sha* programs.

2005-08-28  David Madore  <david.madore@ens.fr>

	* README: Add their names to the list.
	* src/md5sum.c: Provide framework for computing sha-2 hashes.
	* src/Makefile.am (sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum, sha512sum):
	Rules for compiling sha-2 utilities
	(noinst_HEADERS): Remove checksum.h.
	* man/sha512sum.x, man/sha384sum.x, man/sha256sum.x, man/sha224sum.x:
	New files.
	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Add the corresponding .1 names.
	(sha224sum.1, sha256sum.1, sha384sum.1, sha512sum.1): New dependencies.
	* tests/misc/sha224sum, tests/misc/sha256sum: New files.
	* tests/misc/sha384sum, tests/misc/sha512sum: New files.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add new sha224sum, sha256sum,
	sha384sum, sha512sum test scripts here rather that each in its
	own directory.

2005-08-28  David Madore  <david.madore@ens.fr>

	* tests/sha1sum/basic-1 (million-a): Add the "million a's" test (one
	of the FIPS test vectors).
