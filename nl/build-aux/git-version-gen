# This script is derived from GIT-VERSION-GEN from GIT: http://git.or.cz/.
# It may be run two ways:
# - from a git repository in which the git-describe command below
#   produces useful output (thus requiring at least one signed tag)
# - from a non-git-repo directory containing a .version file, which
#   presumes this script is invoked like "./git-version-gen .version".
